Set up your notebook by either wgetting the lesson or tracking it by your own (We would recommend wgetting since there are some fill in the blanks!) | wget here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmaxwu/Tri2-GroupFastpages/master/_notebooks/2022-12-dd-lesson.ipynb | . 3.17: Algorithm Efficiency . Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to help students understand how to make an efficient program and optimize it and understand its importance to the CSP curriculum. . What is Algorithmic Efficiency? . The ability of an algorithm to solve a problem in an efficient way An efficient algorithm solves a problem quickly and with a minimum amount of resources, such as time and memory. | . | How do we determine if an algorithm is efficient or not? One way we can do this is by determining the time complexity of the algorithm. | Another way is through space complexity. | . | . Traveling Merchant Problem Hacks: . What did you and your team discuss? (record below) . An heuristic solution is an approach to a problem that produces a solution that isn&#39;t necessarily optimal but can be used when normal methods take forever &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Describe the method used to solve the traveling merchant problem. (record below) . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; 3.18: Undecidable Problems . Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concept of undecidable problems in computer science and to explain why these problems are important. . Key vocabulary: . Decision problem | Decidable problem | Undecidable problem | . Decision Problem . A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: . Decidable Problems | Undecidable Problems | . A decidable problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not. . An undecidable problem problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem. . Decidable Problems . A decidable problem is an algorithm that can always have an output of yes or no given any input. It is always correct. . Example of a Decidable Problem . The procedure below tests to see if a number is divisible by 13. If it is, it returns true. If it isn&#39;t, it returns false. . def divideThirteen(number): if number % 13 == 0: return True else: return False print(divideThirteen(26)) print(divideThirteen(30)) . True False . Undecidable Problems . An Example of a Forever Running Code . The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer(This is not the python data type &quot;integer&quot;, it&#39;s the integer in number theory). However, there is no end to this code, making the computer run forever. There is no halt to the code. . i = 0 number = 1 def integerTest(n): # Testing if the number is an integer if n%1 ==0: return True else: return False # Using while loop to keep searching an a non-integer above 1. Note that the computer runs forever. while i == 0: number += 1 if integerTest(number) == False: i +=1 print(&quot;Done&quot;) . The Halting Problem . The halting problem is an example of an undecidable problem. It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever. . There is no way to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether a body of code can run forever or not. . Halting Problem Example: . In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let&#39;s call this algorithm HaltChecker. | HaltChecker analyzes the program,program P, and its input,input I. If program P halts with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;halts&quot;. If program P doesn&#39;t halt(runs forever) with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the code runs forever, so HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. | Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses HaltChecker&#39;s output. So, if &quot;never&quot; is the output of HaltChecker, then the output of Reverser is &quot;halts&quot;. It&#39;s also the same the other way around: if HaltChecker has an output of &quot;halts&quot;, then Reverser has an output of &quot;never&quot;. | We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code. | Since Reverser is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints &quot;never&quot; when in fact there is an end(As proved by HaltChecker), and how it also prints &quot;halts&quot; when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by HaltChecker). As a result, HaltChecker is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem. | . This Diagram Sums up the Entire Process in the Bulleted List: . Credits of diagram and example to Khan Academy . FAQ . Q: If Reverser is causing the problem, why not remove it? | A: Removing Reverser will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate. | . Extra Things to Notice . Note that while a computer may take a long time to run a section of code, it does not mean that the computer is going to run forever. | Humans are able to solve some undecidable problems. The entire Halting Problem example was to prove that computers cannot solve undecidable problems. | . Hacks . Come up with one situation in which a computer runs into an undecidable problem. Explain why it is considered an undecidable problem. . An example of an undecidable program is the following: Which is a program that takes in a number and outputs the next prime number. This is an undecidable problem could be the example of a store owner who wants to design a store that sells certain goods however there is not an algorithm that can determine how it should be done as it cannot predict the flow of customers the demand for certain products and the amount of money that will be made. This is an undecidable problem because there is no way to predict the best store layout or the different factors that will affect the store making it an undecidable problem. . 3.17 Homework . Your homework for Algorithmic Efficiency is pretty simple. .

A library is a collection of precompiled codes that can be used later on in a program for some specific well-defined operations. | These precompiled codes can be referred to as modules. Each module contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. | A library may also contain documentation, configuration data, message templates, classes, and values, etc. | . Why are libraries important? . Using Libraries makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. | One example would be through looping and iteration, as we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. | Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc. | . A few libraries that simplify coding processes: . Pillow allows you to work with images. | Tensor Flow helps with data automation and monitors performance. | Matplotlib allows you to make 2D graphs and plots. | . The AP Exam Refrence Sheet itself is a library! . Hacks: . Research two other Python Libraries NOT DISCUSSED DURING LESSON and make a markdown post, explaining their function and how it helps programmers code. . API&#8217;s .

So, what is a simulation anyway? . A simulation is a tested scenario used for viewing results/outputs to prepare for them in real world situations . | These can be used for games like dice rolling, spinners, etc . | These can be used for practical things such as building structures, testing car crashes, and other things before engaging in them in the real world . | These simulations can have the option of obeying real world physics (Gravity, collision) or they can go against these norms since this is a fictitious scenario, and couldn&#39;t happen in real life . | .

Given a height and a weight, they calculate how long it will take for a object to fall to the ground in a vacuum subjected to normal Earth levels of gravity. . However, the second one is a simulation. It calculates the distance the object has fallen every 0.1 seconds. This is useful for if you wanted a visual representation of a falling object, which pure math can&#39;t do as smoothly. . height = float(input(&quot;height in meters?&quot;)) weight = input(&quot;weight in pounds?&quot;) stuff = (2 * (height / 9.8))**(1/2) print(&quot;It will take&quot;, stuff,&quot;seconds for an object that weighs&quot;,weight,&quot;pounds&quot;,&quot;to fall &quot;,height,&quot;meters in a vacuum&quot;) . t = 0 g = 0 d = 0 false = True while false: t = t + 0.1 d = 9.8 / 2 * (t**2) if d &gt;= height: false = False #print(d) # if you want to print the distance every time it calculates it.

Simulations in the wild . Simulations are used extremely frequently in real life applications. One of the most common examples of simulations are video games. A games physics engine can accurately simulate objects colliding . Another example is Blender, the software used in 3d animations class, here at Del Norte. Blender is made up of many small simulations, but one big one it uses is simulating the way light bounces off of and interacts with objects. . Example Simulations . An example of a simulation is like the part seen in the image below made in Autodesk Inventor. Which represents a simulation as simlar to the render in blender it simulates the way light bounces off of and interacts with the object to simulate the reflections it casts on surounding objects and surfaces. Along with the way the light interacts with the object itself and how it creates shadows an aspect not seen in the image is the hole beneath it but using similar simulations the it understands that there will be darker shawdows and lesss reflections in the hole. Also using simulations to handle the way the material appears based on its texture and color accounting for the different ways light interacts with the material specifically. . . HW !!! .

A library is a collection of precompiled codes that can be used later on in a program for some specific well-defined operations. | These precompiled codes can be referred to as modules. Each module contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. | A library may also contain documentation, configuration data, message templates, classes, and values, etc. | . Why are libraries important? . Using Libraries makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. | One example would be through looping and iteration, as we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. | Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc. | . A few libraries that simplify coding processes: . Pillow allows you to work with images. | Tensor Flow helps with data automation and monitors performance. | Matplotlib allows you to make 2D graphs and plots. | . The AP Exam Refrence Sheet itself is a library! . Hacks: . Research two other Python Libraries NOT DISCUSSED DURING LESSON and make a markdown post, explaining their function and how it helps programmers code. . API&#8217;s . An Application Program Interface, or API, contains specific direction for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. | An API acts as a gateway for the imported procedures from a library to interact with the rest of your code. | . Activity: Walkthrough with NumPy . Install NumPy on VSCode: Open New Terminal In VSCode: | pip3 install --upgrade pip | pip install numpy | | . REMEMBER: When running library code cells use Python Interpreter Conda (Version 3.9.12) . Example of using NumPy for arrays: . import numpy as np new_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]]) print (new_matrix) . [[1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9]] . Example of using NumPy for derivatives: . import numpy as np # defining polynomial function var = np.poly1d([2, 0, 1]) print(&quot;Polynomial function, f(x): n&quot;, var) # calculating the derivative derivative = var.deriv() print(&quot;Derivative, f(x)&#39;=&quot;, derivative) # calculates the derivative of after # given value of x print(&quot;When x=5 f(x)&#39;=&quot;, derivative(5)) . Polynomial function, f(x): 2 2 x + 1 Derivative, f(x)&#39;= 4 x When x=5 f(x)&#39;= 20 . Random Values . Random number generation (RNG) produces a random number (crazy right?) This means that a procedure with RNG can return different values even if the parameters (inputs) do not change | . | CollegeBoard uses RANDOM(A, B), to return an integer between integers A and B. RANDOM(1, 10) can output 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 | In Python, this would be random.randint(A, B), after importing Python&#39;s &quot;random&quot; library (import random) | JavaScript&#39;s works a little differently, with Math.random() returning a value between 0 and 1. To match Python and CollegeBoard, you could make a procedure like this | . | . | . CollegeBoard Example: What is the possible range of values for answ3 . Convert the following procedure to Python, then determine the range of outputs if n = 5. .

Homework . Write a procedure that generates n random numbers, then sorts those numbers into lists of even and odd numbers (JS or Python, Python will be easier). . | Using NumPy and only coding in python cell, find the answer to the following questions: a. What is the derivative of 2x^5 - 6x^2 + 24x? b. What is the derivative of (13x^4 + 4x^2) / 2 when x = 9? . | Suppose you have a group of 10 dogs and 10 cats, and you want to create a random order for them. Show how random number generation could be used to create this random order. . | Modules . requests: Allows you to send HTTP requests to web servers and get responses back. Has built in functions for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. (the most common HTTP requests). Highly customizable allowing you to set headers, cookies, and other parameters. Which allows the module to be used for a wide variety of tasks such as web scraping, web automation, and API testing. . | emoji: Allows you to use emojis in your code.

So, what is a simulation anyway? . A simulation is a tested scenario used for viewing results/outputs to prepare for them in real world situations . | These can be used for games like dice rolling, spinners, etc . | These can be used for practical things such as building structures, testing car crashes, and other things before engaging in them in the real world . | These simulations can have the option of obeying real world physics (Gravity, collision) or they can go against these norms since this is a fictitious scenario, and couldn&#39;t happen in real life . | .

Given a height and a weight, they calculate how long it will take for a object to fall to the ground in a vacuum subjected to normal Earth levels of gravity. . However, the second one is a simulation. It calculates the distance the object has fallen every 0.1 seconds. This is useful for if you wanted a visual representation of a falling object, which pure math can&#39;t do as smoothly. . height = float(input(&quot;height in meters?&quot;)) weight = input(&quot;weight in pounds?&quot;) stuff = (2 * (height / 9.8))**(1/2) print(&quot;It will take&quot;, stuff,&quot;seconds for an object that weighs&quot;,weight,&quot;pounds&quot;,&quot;to fall &quot;,height,&quot;meters in a vacuum&quot;) . t = 0 g = 0 d = 0 false = True while false: t = t + 0.1 d = 9.8 / 2 * (t**2) if d &gt;= height: false = False #print(d) # if you want to print the distance every time it calculates it.

            "content": "Calling Procedures . Slide 1: . A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arugments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value, then you will assign that value to a variable | .

Developing Procedures . Slide 8: . Picking a decriptive name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals) There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. . Slide 9: . In this example, a teacher is writing a program that will replace the grade on a previous quiz if the new grade is better than the previous. .

Procedural Abstraction . One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it | This is very helpful in managing complexity in a program | Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called modularity | A procedural abstraction may extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity | When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it | Simply, procedural abstraction is naming and calling a prewritten procedure | Making sure to include the right arguments so the procedure can do what its supposed to do is crucial | .

            "content": "3.9 Part 1 . The lesson will start off with introducing what algorithms are and what they do, moreover, what their significance is. . 3.9 Lesson 1 has the objective to teach the student of the outcome of similar algorithmic concepts and similar algorithms. In this lesson, you will see different ways on how algorithms are developed. . Lesson 1 | Defining Algorithms . What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed through CODE. There are set limitations, this is what makes algorithms fun, you can your imagination and create whatever you wan with your own instructions! . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks . | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results. . | Some conditional statements can be written as the same as Boolean expressions (VICE VERSA) . | Different algorithms can be developed or use to solve the same problem. . | . Example 1 | What happens if we test the algorithm with different outputs? . The pseudocode above is translated to python for you. . Record what your outputs are when you enter 95 degrees F, does the algorithm yield the same result? . The conditional below is nested . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then 95, what do you notice? # It will print that it is too cold to play outside . It is too cold outside! . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then 95, what do you notice? # It will print that it is too hot to play outside . It&#39;s too hot outside! . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) elif (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then Input 95, what do you notice? # It prints that is both too hot to be outside and that it&#39;ll play out side this could be corrected with the above changes # If 54 was inputted it would correctly print that it is too cold to play outside . It&#39;s too hot outside! Sure I will play outside! . NOW RECORD with another output . Record what your outputs are when you enter 54, does the algorithm yield the same result this time? . *Now use 95 as an input for the two code blocks above. . Even though an algorithm&#39;s code can look the same, you have to be careful, they can always yield different results. When constructing algorithms you want to make sure that your code corresponds with what you want as your output. You set the limit of your code and you decide what the code&#39;s output is. . Conditionals vs. Booleans . The condition and instructions are what differ, that&#39;s where the magic happens. The condition is a boolean expression when an expression outputs either true or false. Boolean values are another type of data type in programming languages, and they can only ever hold true or false. . Exercise . Learning how to utilize conditionals and booleans are important for developing algorithms. Use this exercise to help you. . Can either Boolean expression on the right replace the conditional on the left? Assume isWeekday and isHoliday are Boolean variables. . *NOTE = you can edit the variables to check the conditions needed! . IsHoliday = False IsWeekday = True if IsHoliday: driveWork = True else: if IsWeekday: driveWork = True else: driveWork = False print(driveWork) . Logically thinking about conditionals and booleans . Now the problem may seem confusing, but the best way to develop an algorithm is to think about all the possible results that can be potentially be outputted. . So if IsHoliday is set to true, then driveWork is automatically equal to false and it does not matter what value of isWeekday is. This must mean that one of the conditionals must be NOT IsHoliday. . In the case that lets say IsHoliday is set to false, then the variable for weekday needs to be checked. If it&#39;s true then driveWork is true, if it&#39;s false then driveWork is false. This must mean that the other conditional isWeekday. . Combining both conditionals, you get option 2, which is not IsHoliday and IsWeekday. This is why option 2 is right! . Example 3 | Conditionals vs Booleans . The following algorithms are intended to sum the odd numbers from 1-9. Which algorithms work as intended? . Below, I have translated the block code into python, import this to your jupyter notebook and record the result. What do you notice? . First block . sum = 1 counter = 3 #iteration var = 0 while (var &lt; 4): #while the var is &lt;= 4, it executes those commands, once it exceeds it hits the else command sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 var = var + 1 # now go through the whole thing 4 times, this is an iteration, a vital part of algorithms. else: print(sum) . 25 . Second block . sum = 0 counter = 9 #iteration while (counter &gt;= 1): sum = sum + counter counter = counter - 2 print(sum) . 25 . When we start our initializing left sum as 1 counter as 3 we had no iterations yet. Remember we&#39;re going to have to repeat this four times because the block code prompts us to repeat 4 times, so we iterate. So as we go through and follow what the block gives us. . So you see that the sum does work, it does sum up the odd numbers from 1-9 . Now lets look at the right block. . Sum is set to 0 Counter is set to 9 We must repeat until the counter &lt; 1 is true. . So we keep adding until -1, that is when the counter &lt; 1 is true, so we stop . So why is it important to understand that algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same task? . An algorithm is beautiful that way, just because you think of solving a problem differently, doesn&#39;t mean your wrong, . 3.9 Part 2 . Flowcharts . Flowcharts can help you visualize the functionality of an algorithm . | They are a good way to double check whether or not your algorithm is achieving its purpose . | . How To Set Up A Flowchart . label the start point . | Define any and all variables you may need . | Consider the first question you want the algorithm to ask . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is yes (or true) . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is no (or false) . Steps 3-5 are the steps to creating code that uses a process called selection (you can convert the question from step 3 to a conditional if-statement in code) | . | Write out all necessary steps for the algorithm to function properly . | You may want your algorithm to iterate some steps until a condition is met . You can write the steps that need to be repeated, then draw an arrow from the last step to a step above that contains a conditional statement | . | determine a way to reach the end goal | Selection vs. Iteration . Selection: . A process used in algorithms where a conditional if-statement leads to one of two outcomes . Outcome 1: if the conditional statement is true, something will happen . | Outcome 2: if the conditional statement is false, something else will happen . | Ex: see example A . | . | . | Iteration . A process used in algorithms that allows certain things to happen until a condition is satisfied . Once the condition is satisfied, then an outcome is produced . | This can take the form of a for-loop, while-loop, and/or if-statement . | . | . | . Example A . Consider this situation: . You are shopping for your favorite food at your favorite supermarket . | You see that there is a sale on wheat products for 35% off . | There is another sale on produce for 20% off . | These sales are mutually exclusive . | Tax on all items is 8% . | . | Your TASK: . Create a flowchart for an algorithm that can be used to calculate the cost of your favorite item | . | . Example A Possible Solution (using Selection) . 3.9 Part 3 . For Algorithms How to combine and/or modify an existing algorithm. | . | . Benefits of combining algorithms can reduce development time, testing time, and simplify the identification of errors. | . | . Example in Class .

Takeaways . You can use code you&#39;ve previously wrote in order to make a project easier. | Breaking algorithms down into steps can make things easier and more simple. | . Hacks . create another algorithm using a famous mathematical algorithm such as the &quot;collatz conjecture.&quot; and explain your steps in a post on a blog. | . 3.11 Binary Search . Goals/Objectives: . detirmine number of iterations required to find vlue in data set. | explain requirements for binary search | . What is Binary Search? . Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. | An algorithm for iterating to find a value inside a data set | . About Binary Search: . Binary Search Algorithm starts in the middle of a data set of numbers and eliminates half the data. This process reapeats until the desired value is found or until all elements have been eliminated. | In order to use binary search effectivly and properly, data must be stored in order | COLLEGE BOARD INDEX STARTS AT 1 NOT 0 | . Think about how you would you would try to find a certain number in this set. . One way would be to line up the numbers and count them individually untill you find the desired value. . When working with large data sets with lots of numbers, methods like these wont work . Instead, a Binary Search would be more effective. | . Here we can see the numbers are set in an increasing order. Setting numbers in an increasing or decreasing is needed for a binary search . Binary search is started with the middle number first Middle number is found by taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two | . | Binary Search can be represented using a tree as shown below | . . Heres an easy way to put it: . binary search fidns the desired element by continuously chopping the search area in half | say the element you are looking for is &#39;f&#39; | . [a b c d e f g h] . We would start in the middle at element &#39;d&#39; | becuase our target is greater than d we will eliminate everything left of &#39;d&#39; including &#39;d&#39; (chopping it in half) . [e f g h] is what now remains . again we would &#39;chop in half&#39; | say we iterate through &#39;g&#39; and &#39;h&#39;, our desired element is still not found so we would eliminate &#39;g; and &#39;h&#39; and continue the process | . [e f] . now we are down to 2 elements | &#39;chopping in half&#39; will give us our desired element | . [f] . | . def BinarySearch(array, x, low, high): # Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each other while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low)//2 # find the middle (taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two) if array[mid] == x: # if desired number is the middle is found return desired number (middle number) return mid elif array[mid] &lt; x: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 return -1 array = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] x = 4 result = BinarySearch(array, x, 0, len(array)-1) if result != -1: print(&quot;Element is present at index &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not found&quot;) . Element is present at index 1 . We have created a function called binary_search() function which takes two arguments - a list to be sorted and a number to be searched. . | We have declared two variables to store the lowest and highest values in the list. The lowest is assigned initial value to 0, the highest to len(list1) 1 and mid as 0. . | Next, we have declared the while loop with the condition that the lowest is equal and smaller than the highest. The while loop will iterate if the number has not been found yet. . | In the while loop, we find the mid value and compare the index value to the number we are searching for. . | If the value of the mid-index is smaller than n, we increase the mid value by 1 and assign it to the low. The search moves to the left side. . | Otherwise, if the value of mid index is larger than n, we decrease the mid value by 1 and assign it to the high. The search moves to the right side. . | If the n is equal to the mid value then return mid. . | This will happen until the low is equal and smaller than the high. . | If we reach at the end of the function, then the element is not present in the list. We return -1 to the calling function. . | . . Hacks . Using my example above and steps below, create your own iteration using binary search . Steps . Compare x with the middle element. | If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index. | Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half. | Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half. | . def BinarySearcher(sortedlist, x): beginning = 0 mid = 0 end = len(sortedlist)-1 while beginning &lt;= end: mid = (beginning+end)//2 if sortedlist[mid] == x: return mid elif sortedlist[mid] &gt; x: end = mid - 1 else: beginning = mid + 1 return -1 x = int(input(&quot;Integer to search through&quot;)) sortedlist = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20] result = BinarySearcher(sortedlist,x) if result != -1: print(&quot;Element is present at index &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not found&quot;) .

Lists are just one of four collection data types in Python . Tuple: collection that is ordered, unchangeable, allows duplicates | Set: collection that is unordered, unchangeable, doesn&#39;t allow duplicates | Dictionary: collection that is ordered, changeable, doesn&#39;t allow duplicates | . Terms . Index: a term used to sort data in order to reference to an element in a list (allows for duplicates) | Elements: the values in the list assigned to an index | . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;grape&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;] index = 1 print (fruits[index]) . Methods in Lists . Method Definition Example . append() | adds element to the end of the list | fruits.append(&quot;watermelon&quot;) | . index() | returns the index of the first element with the specified value | fruits.index(&quot;apple&quot;) | . insert() | adds element at given position | fruits.insert(1, &quot;watermelon&quot;) | . remove() | removes the first item with the specified value | fruits.remove(&quot;strawberry&quot;) | . reverse() | reverses the list order | fruits.reverse() | . sort() | sorts the list | fruits.sort() | . count() | returns the amount of elements with the specified value | fruits.count(&quot;apple&quot;) | . copy() | returns a copy of the list | fruits.copy() | . clear() | removes the elements from the list | fruits.clear() | . sports = [&quot;football&quot;, &quot;soccer&quot;, &quot;baseball&quot;, &quot;basketball&quot;] # change the value &quot;soccer&quot; to &quot;hockey&quot; sports.remove(&quot;soccer&quot;) sports.insert(1, &quot;hockey&quot;) print (sports) .

Coding all of these individually takes a lot of unnecessary time, how can we shorten this time? . Iteration . Iteration is the repetition of a process or utterance applied to the result or taken from a previous statement. There&#39;s a lot of types of iteration though, what to use? How do we apply iteration to lists? . Some methods include using a &quot;for loop&quot;, using a &quot;for loop and range()&quot;, using a &quot;while loop&quot;, and using comprehension . Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are iterable objects. They are the &#39;containers&#39; that store the data to iterate. . Each of these containers are able to iterate with the iter() command. . There are 2 types of iteration:definite and indefinite. Definite iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met . for variable in iterable: statement() . Iterator? Iterable? Iteration? . When an object is iterable it can be used in an iteration | When passed through the function iter() it returns an iterator | Strings, lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples are all examples of iterable objects. | . a = [&#39;alpha&#39;, &#39;bravo&#39;, &#39;charlie&#39;] itr = iter(a) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) . alpha bravo charlie .

A 2D array is simply just a list of lists. The example below is technically correct but... . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Conventially 2D arrays are written like below. This is because 2D arrays are meant to be read in 2 dimensions (hence the name). Writing them like below makes them easier to visualize and understand. . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Printing a 2D Array . We already know that we can&#39;t just print the matrix by calling it. We need to iterate through it to print it. . def print_matrix1(matrix): for i in range(len(matrix)): # outer for loop. This runs on i which represents the row. range(len(matrix)) is in order to iterate through the length of the matrix for j in range(len(matrix[i])): # inner for loop. This runs on the length of the i&#39;th row in the matrix (j changes for each row with a different length) print(matrix[i][j], end=&quot; &quot;) # [i][j] is the 2D location of that value in the matrix, kinda like a coordinate pair. [i] iterates to the specific row and [j] iterates to the specific value in the row. end=&quot; &quot; changes the end value to space, not a new line. print() # prints extra line. this is in the outer loop, not the inner loop, because it only wants to print a new line for each row . print(&quot;Raw matrix (list of lists): &quot;) print(keypad) print(&quot;Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration:&quot;) print_matrix1(keypad) print() . Raw matrix (list of lists): [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&#39; &#39;, 0, &#39; &#39;]] Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . def print_matrix2(matrix): for row in matrix: # Iterates through each &quot;row&quot; of matrix. Row is a dummy variable, it could technically be anything. It iterates through each value of matrix and each value is it&#39;s own list. in this syntax the list is stored in &quot;row&quot;. for col in row: # Iterates through each value in row. Again col, column, is a dummy variable. Each value in row is stored in col. print(col, end=&quot; &quot;) # Same as 1 print() # Same as 1 print_matrix2(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . More Functions . Try to find another way to print the matrix. Only complete one of the two (unless you&#39;d like to do both). Below is a hint . fruit = [&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;bananas&quot;, &quot;grapes&quot;] print(fruit) print(*fruit) # Python built in function: &quot;*&quot;. Figure out what it does . [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;bananas&#39;, &#39;grapes&#39;] apples bananas grapes . def print_matrix3(matrix): code = &quot;your code goes here&quot; # Don&#39;t have to do one . Alternatively, find a way to print the matrix using the iter() function you already learned. Or use both! . Homework . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] def print_matrix4(keypad): iterations = iter(keypad) while True: try: row = next(iterations) for column in row: print(column, end = &quot; &quot;) print() except StopIteration: break print_matrix4(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 .

D E C E M B E R 1 6 . Challenge also homework . Change all of the letters that you DIDN&#39;T print above to spaces, &quot; &quot;, and then print the full keyboard. (the things you did print should remain in the same spot) . Alternative Challenge: If you would prefer, animate it using some form of delay so it flashes one of your letters at a time on the board in order and repeats. (this one may be slightly more intuitive) . DO NOT HARD CODE THIS. Don&#39;t make it harder on yourself, iterate through, make it abstract so it can be used dynamically. You should be able to input any string and your code should work. . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] def printer(keyboard): rsp = input(&quot;Month: &quot;) rsp2 = input(&quot;Age: &quot;) solve_rsp = &quot;&quot; + str(rsp.upper().strip()) solve_rsp2 = &quot;&quot; + str(rsp2).strip().upper() for letter in solve_rsp: if any(letter in row for row in keyboard): # print(letter) for row in keyboard: if letter in row: row[row.index(letter)] = &quot; &quot; for letter in solve_rsp2: if any(letter in row for row in keyboard): # print(letter) for row in keyboard: if letter in row: row[row.index(letter)] = &quot; &quot; for row in keyboard: print(&quot; &quot;.join(row)) printer(keyboard) . ` 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 0 - = Q W T Y U I O P [ ] A S F G H J K L ; &#39; Z X V N , . / .

            "content": "Lesson Overview: 3.5 - Boolean Expressions . Here we will focus on: basics of Booleans | its relationship with binary | relational operators | Logical Operators | . | . What is a boolean? . A data type with two possible values: true or false | . Boolean and Binary . So similar yet so different. . Boolean math and binary notation both use the same two ciphers: 1 and 0. | However, please note that Boolean quantities are restricted to a singlular bit (can only be either 1, or 0) | On the otherhand, binary numbers may be composed of many bits adding up in place-weighted form to any finite value, or size | . Must Knows . A Boolean value is either TRUE or FALSE | The AP Exam will provide you with a reference sheet with the operators below. | . A few ways these operators could be used... | . Relational Operators in action . How could you use operators to determine if the average of 5 grades is greater than 80? | . With the grades below, use a boolean expression to determine if the average grade is above an 80 and print the result (True or False) | Try it in as few steps as possible! | Be creative! There are obviously TONS of different practical solutions | . grade1 = 90 grade2 = 65 grade3 = 60 grade4 = 75 grade5 = 95 grades = grade1 + grade2 + grade3 + grade4 + grade5 average = grades % 5 average &gt; 80 if average == 0: print(&quot;false&quot;) else: print(&quot;true&quot;) . false . The versatility of relational operators: . print(&quot;100 == 100:&quot;,100==100) print(&quot;Hello == Adios:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;==&quot;farewell&quot;) print(&quot;Hello != Adios:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;!=&quot;farewell&quot;) print(&quot;Hello == Hola:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;==&quot;greeting&quot;) print(&quot;5&gt;=4:&quot;, 5&gt;=4) print (&#39;&#39;) # Notice that relational operators can even work on lists! # For lists, the relational operator compares each respective component until an answer is derived print(&quot;[&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;] &gt; [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;]:&quot;, [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;] &gt; [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] &gt; [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] &gt; [1,2,3,4]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] &lt; [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] &lt; [1,2,3,4]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]) . 100 == 100: True Hello == Adios: False Hello != Adios: True Hello == Hola: True 5&gt;=4: True [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;] &gt; [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;]: False [1,2,3,5] &gt; [1,2,3,4]: True [1,2,3,5] &lt; [1,2,3,4]: False [1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]: False . Logical Operators! . These types of operators don&#39;t necessarily deal with equivalent/non-equivalent values, but they rather work on operands to produce a singular boolean result . AND : returns TRUE if the operands around it are TRUE | OR : returns TRUE if at least one operand is TRUE | NOT : returns TRUE if the following boolean is FALSE | . Turn the following arithmetic phrases into either True or False statements as indicated USING LOGICAL OPERATORS . print(&quot;1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12:&quot;, 1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12) # Output TRUE using OR ^ # Output FALSE using NOT print(&quot;24 &gt; 8:&quot;, not 24 &gt; 8) # Output FALSE using AND print(&quot;10 &gt; 20:&quot;, 10 &gt; 20 and False) . 1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12: True 24 &gt; 8: False 10 &gt; 20: False . Lesson Overview: 3.6 - Conditionals . Focusing on Selection . Selection: uses a condition that evaluates to true or false . Selection determines which part of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false . Algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task . Conditional Statements . Also known as &quot;if statements&quot; . Can be seen as if statements or if blocks . Can also be seen as if else statements or if else-blocks . x = 20 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) . x is greater than y . x = 20 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is not greater than y&quot;) . x is greater than y . Participation . -Calculate the total sum of two numbers, if it is equal to 200, print 200, if otherwise, print the sum. . num1 = 200 num2 = 200 sum = num1 + num2 print(str(sum) + &quot;You don&#39;t need a condtional for this&quot; ) . 400 . Lesson Overview - 3.7 Nested Conditionals . Nested conditional statements consist of conditional statements within other conditional statements | Utilizes &quot;if else&quot; statements within &quot;if else&quot; statements | . Basics of a nested conditional: | . Block Coding Visual of Nested Conditionals: | Example Psuedocode of Nested Conditional Statements | . Analyzing Code Walkthrough . Psuedocode to the left, block code to the right | Approach the problem by going through each condition one at a time . Decide which ones are false to skip and which ones are true to execute | . | You Try: . | . Psuedocode: Lives would print 4 as the result of the and &amp; or is false it would print 4 as it is the result of 4 - 1 which is the value for lives . score = 82 if (score &gt;= 90) { console.log(&quot;You got an A, congrats!&quot;) } else { if (score &gt;= 75) { console.log(&quot;Please come to retake up to a 90 next week at tutorial!&quot;) } else { console.log(&quot;You have detention!&quot;) } } .

Iteration is correctly labeled (extra). But the steps are written in sentences instead of being written in symbols. Also, the “sum = 0” should be in a rectangle because it’s a process. You also should have set “count = 0,” but everything else looks good. | 0.3/0.5 | Good job on warm up hacks however the answers for the string concatenation problem were very incorrect you had numbers instead of flavors and an error in your other problem in regards to order printing. I would look at the posted solution and revise. Also no pseudocode predictions were made and result was not evaluated. | 0.8/1 | . Derek | 0.5/0.5 | Very Neat! Good job on correctly utilizing all of the shapes. All steps are fully complete, but the “start” and the “sum = 0” steps should be separated, and you’re missing the “stop” step at the end. | 0.2/0.5 | Good Job on your warm up problems.

All you’re missing is the “stop” step at the end and you were meant to add the “sum = 0” and “count = 0” as a step in the actual flowchart instead of as a sticky to the side, same goes for the “if count &lt; 6” step. | 0.5/0.5 . One of your questions was incorrect, but we gave you a bonus for showing your work . | Very good on your conversion along with predictions for your warm up hacks however there was no prediction made for the string problems in psuedocode there will be no access to a computer during the ap exam so practice needs to be maintained for these skills | 1/1 | .

The major reason for this issue was misunderstanding the question and not finding the value for result which was what the question had asked for. The best way to solve this issue would be to re-read the problem and to pay attention to all aspects not just what would be the first answer that would come to mind when looking at the problem. . . When solving the problem I had not taken into account that the &gt; while excluding 0 in the first portion of the conditional statement, however the else condition would be applicable to 0 making the value for count2 to not be 2 but 3 indicated in the correct answer.

Throughout this Trimester many groups of students have worked hard to display the full course of their understading via there Night at the Museum Project, however, we as group throughout the development process may have focused on our project, we gained the ability to reflect based on the outstanding work that many groups have down also showcasing their learning. These are my personal notes on the that they presented at Night at the Museum. . Api Notes . Alan, Steven, Ederick, Noor, Liav - calendar that shows date and weather, can put in an event on any day and it saves, can search for any city weather . Luke - Has a variety of quizzes to choose from to use them to generate random questions, geography, math, and sat questions. About pages linkes to eveyone fastpages. . Paaras, Samarth, AJ, Haoxuan - An api that grabs some of the best of best motivational qoutes from the internet, and allows users to vote on the quality of the votes through hosting a number counter. Also are able to pulled to get a random qoutes. . Peacock Justin, James, Shruti, Joslyn - recreation of the classic game tetris, and through the use of astronomy api to create table based on the city name and gives location details longitude latitude and moon traits. . Advay, Krishiv, Shivansh, Dhruva, Prasith - Motivational qputes api to curate qoutes accross the internet, and heleaps pepple calculate goals and calories, BMI calculator, and fitness goals. . Jonathan, Martin, Abdulla, Leonard - Basketball stats of each NBA team, used an api to get the stats fpr each team and through thier website made it accesable to the user with ease. . Lyntax Aniket, Soham, Ryan, Lucas - One api with a dictionary hosted on a flask server that has words and definitions so users can imput it against a word. Which serves to play a hangman game. Which also eliminates letters and dynamically renders the charector. . Ananya, Sreeja, Aliya, Clair - Wordle game that uses thier custom api that imports and uses it randomly uses it to generate a game. Also checks if words are valid are not and informs the user if they are incorrect or not. . Raunak, Tanay, Yuri, Sachit, Harsha - Clock alarm and stopwatch, using a custom api to request data from a variety of time of timezones to display times. . Lily, Ekam, Ishi, Shreyas - Uses a custom dictionary api of different words and thier definitions to allow users to find them and a word of the day that changes. Along with a feedback to adapt the user experience. . Aiden ahad dash sabine - Innovative api that has games such as tetris, blackjack, cookie clicker, and a pokemon game with custom to log losses wins, correct answers wrong and other game data. . The fream team we make code with varalu azeem chubmag and colin, we made and acedemic organizer, with a custom api that fetches information predominantly wikipedia and stores the data to make an acedmic organizer . Devon, trent, drew, jager - Made custom api to conpare likes to dislikes to pull it as an alarm for a stopwatch is able to manage your workflow through several options, such as notifications, that can keep you on track, and set break intervals, and tasks . Keira, Zeen, Ellie, Giannina - Made custom custmoer survey along with a quiz that has three different quizzes for calculus, physics, and satstics, with soultion with randomized questions from a database. Along with a quiz summary and a customer service api that prompts users woth questions saving them to a data base. Along with an explanation to show how the problems you missed could be solved. . Reflections . In my opinion this showcases the vast strides many students inclusing myself have made this trimester, with coming from barely understanding any CS concepts prior to this class have been able to grow and develop to make a large variety of projects based apon their understanding of APIs, CSS, HTML, Fastpages, and Python. From creating projcts like ours via games, from Pokemon, Tetris, to other educational tools like quizzes on wide variety of topics or other tools like health trackers, and calanders everyone showcased an amount of growth one may not think possible in just one trimester. .",

Through creating a variable that measures the incorrect attempts and one that measures the correct events that are integers to be able to store the score the player gets and change based on answers given. | . Managing Complexity . To prevent the quiz from becoming too complicated I would reduce the amount of functions it would perform as in not becoming too sidetracked on adding flash cards.

The code would make use of function to be able to run quizzes allowing operation such as starting to be done only once saving repeatedly used code. | Creating functions that would remove repeated events such as switching pages or other similar functions. | . Algorithm Implementation . Would use an algorithm for printing scores of correct and incorrect answers or pages visited through concatenation of strings from the data stored in the variables. | .

            "title": "Tirth Thakkar Measurements And Graphical Analysis Lab",
            "content": "Procedure: All 5 disks will be labeled, then have thier radius measured using a meter stick, after which they will be weighed on a digtal scale to collect data regarding their mass. Then their thickness was measured by using a meter stick. After the data regarding the radius and mass was put into a table, which was used to create graph 1 through sheets. After which the graph was linearlized by using r2 as the x value as it is the only value that isn’t constant to create graph2 after imputing it into sheets and creating a graph. . Purpose Statement: . Given “disks” of different radii, determine the relationship between the mass and radius of the disks through graphical method. . In using graphical method, we will learn about linearization and the use of it to create a mathematical model. . Equations: . p=m/v . | m=p*v . | V=a*h . | m=p*a*h . | m=p*pi*r^2*h . | Data Table: .   Height Radius (cm) Mass(g)   Radius^2 (cm^2) . Disk 1 | 0.14 mm | 2.38 | 0.08 |   | 5.66 | . Disk 2 |   | 3.15 | 0.14 |   | 9.92 | . Disk 3 |   | 3.80 | 0.24 |   | 14.44 | . Disk 4 |   | 5.40 | 0.38 |   | 29.16 | . Disk 5 |   | 6.85 | 0.71 |   | 46.92 | . Graph 1 . Graph 2 . . y = 0.0148x - 3.1*10-3 . Analysis Questions: . 1) What is the independent variable in your y = mx +b formula? The independent variable on the formula would be r2 it is the only constant variable across all the formulas. . As the density is equal to ⍴ = m/v and as density is constant m can be m = ⍴v, and as v = a*h, and expanded it would be v = π*r2*h, so when substituted into the equation for mass m = ⍴*π*r2*h, and as all three values density (all discs are aluminum), π (constant), h (all are the same thickness) are constant it would make r2 the only value that changes between all 5 discs making it the independent variable. . -——————————————————————————————————————– . 2) What does the slope represent in your y = mx +b formula? Show dimensionally that indeed that is what your slope represents and that the formula is valid dimensionally. . The slope represents ⍴πh. As the equation for density is ⍴ = m/v and as ⍴ is constant it allows for m = πv, which allows for it to be rewritten as m = ⍴*π*h*r2 and as m is the y value and r2 is the x value it can be further rewritten as y = ⍴*π*h*x making ⍴πh the slope. And the formula is m = ⍴*π*h*r2 is demensionally valid as . m = (m(πr2h)-1)(h)(r2) which is M = (M(L2L)-1)(L)(L2), M = M (L-3)(L3), M = M . -——————————————————————————————————————– . 3) Should the “b” in your y = mx + b formula be zero? Explain your answer. . Yes as the independent variable is r2 and as a disc with the radius of 0 should also have a mass of 0 (dependent variable). . -——————————————————————————————————————– . 4) Measure/estimate the “thickness” of your cylinders. Use that value to find the experimental density of your cylinders. Find a percent difference between your found density and the actual density. The actual material is aluminum. . The thickness value of the cylinders was 0.14 mm (0.014 cm), with a slope of 0.0148 (⍴*π*h), ⍴ = 0.0148/π*(0.014 cm), ⍴ = 0.336 g/cm3, compared to the real density of aluminum which is 2.3/cm3. | 0.336-2.3 | /2.3 *100, 85.39% error. | . -——————————————————————————————————————– . 5) errors. Make sure you explain why your number is bigger or smaller than (if positive or negative difference.) . My number is substantially smaller as when using the line of best fit the value for the y-intercept is not 0 i.e. when r2 = 0 the value for mass is not 0 which is not possible in real life meaning that that decrepency coupled with the fact that the measuring techniques through using a meter stick to estimate the thickness and radius of the disks would also be less accurate than proper electronic measurements in a lab. . -——————————————————————————————————————– . Synthesis Questions: . 1) In this experiment, if we had used disks with a greater thickness, would the slope . of your best fit line have been different? Would your experimental value for density be . the same? Explain. . If disks of greater thickness was used the value for slope would be different as previously mentioned when the expanded equation for mass which is m = ⍴*π*h*r2 . is rewritten would be y = ⍴*π*h(x), and which would make ⍴*π*h the slope and as h is a part of the slope value and if it were greater it would make the slope greater. However, the density would stay the same as the material would remain unchanged as if the height was greater it would also cause the mass to increase and it would cancel out when solving for the density. . -——————————————————————————————————————– . 2) How would your graph of m versus r2 be different if you had used disks of the same . thickness, but made out of steel? Draw a second line on your m versus r2 plot that . represents disks made of steel. . If you had used disks made of steel but of the same thickness, you would have disks of a greater density than that of the aluminum graph. Which would cause the graph mass vs r2 to be above that of the one made of aluminum. . . -——————————————————————————————————————– . 3) Another group of students has acquired data for the exact same experiment; . however, their disks are made of an unknown material that they are trying to . determine. The group’s m versus r2 data produced a line of best fit with slope equal to . 122 kg/m2. Each disk they measured had the same 0.5 cm thickness. Calculate the . density of the unknown material and use the table below to help determine what . material their disks are made of. . m = ⍴*π*h*r2, y = ⍴*π*h(x), 122kg/m2 = ⍴*π*0.005, 122/0.005π = ⍴, ⍴ = 7,766.76 kg/m3, 7,766.761kg/m3 * 1000g/kg = 7,766,761g/m3 * 1*106 cm3/m3 = 7,766,761g/1*106, 7.766761g/cm3 approx 7.8 = Iron . -——————————————————————————————————————– . Multiple Choice: . 1) &gt; - E . 1. &gt; m = ⍴ *π *h *r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, C = 2πr, C/2π = r, m = ⍴ *π *h *(C/2π)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, m = ⍴ *π *h *C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4π&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ⍴ *h *C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4π, ⍴h/4π(x), . 2) &gt; - C . 1. &gt; ⍴ = m/v and as density is constant m can be m = ⍴v, and as v = 4/3πr&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, so when substituted into the equation for mass m = ⍴ *π *4/3πr&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and the only non constant is r&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; making it the only value that would lineralize the graph .
