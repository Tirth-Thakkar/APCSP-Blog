Picture Encoding . Essential Question: What are some methods that we could store and access images in the backend, and how can we send them to a frontend application? . The image encoding process for this project is done within the endpoints created on our backend application. The overarching process is split into three seperate sub-processes, each handling a different level of game-difficulty. For this lesson, we will look at the easy images sub-process as our example. . def get_random_easy_image(): images = Images.query.filter_by(_difficulty=0).all() image = random.choice(images) return image . This procedure is a void function that takes in no arguments directly, but does access the database via the Images object imported from the models that we created . The first line filters all database entries and searches for all image entries with the difficulty column set to 0, which we established as the identifying factor for easy images. The .all() method attached to the end of the query serves to return all matching image objects in a list called image. . The procedure finally returns a random image using the random.choice method. . class ImagesAPI: class _EasyImages(Resource): def get(self): image = get_random_easy_image() json_data = {} if image: image_path = project_path + &quot;/&quot; + image.imagePath with open(image_path, &quot;rb&quot;) as image_file: json_data[&quot;bytes&quot;] = str(base64.b64encode(image_file.read()))[2:][:-1] json_data[&quot;xCoord&quot;] = image.xCoord json_data[&quot;yCoord&quot;] = image.yCoord return jsonify(json_data) . If the first procedure locates and selects the image, the second procedure then encodes, formats, and returns the JSON data containing the image and its metadata. . The procedure first calls the get_random_easy_image() procedure created earlier to store our image object and also initializes an empty dictionary to store our json data. . If a valid image object is found, the procedure will attempt to create an absolute path to the image file on the computer running flask application. This is achieved by concatenating the absolute path of the working project directory to the relative image path stored in the database. The aboslute path of the directory is generated in our namespace package (__init__.py) in our _nighthawkguessr_api_ package. The line calculating the project path is shown below, and uses the Path object from the pathlib library. . project_path = Path.cwd().as_posix() . After creating the image path, the procedure attempts to open the image file, and procedes to use the base64.b64encode method to encode the image file bytes into base64 data. This is convinient for us as HTML on the frontend pages allows us to render images with base64 bytes (Not sure about normal image bytes). The base64 bytes are then encoded into a python literal string in order to be jsonified and displayed on the api endpoint. The [2:][:-1] appended to the end is a type of string slicing which removes the b&#39; generated at the start of the data and the &#39; generated at the end of the data. These extraneous characters are used to indicate a base64 string, and are not part of the original data. . The procedure finally appends the metadata (position of the right coordinates on the map) to the json_data dictionary, completing the process. . Finally, the procedure returns the JSONified data, which is accessible from our API. As you can see, the images we process are extremely large and possess high resolution (typically a few megabytes!) . Popcorn Hack: . Please write a few sentences answering the essential question, &quot;What are some methods that we could store and access images in the backend, and how can we send them to a frontend application?&quot; . We can store images in the backend database by using a blob datatype or we can use a file to store images or some other form of storage such as in the cloud. We can send them to the frontend by sending the images as response form an api by hosting the images in some form such as aws possibly or maybe by sending the files in a way that can be read by the frontend from the sent json data. | . Endpoints . What are endpoints and how do we use them to transfer data from one part of the internet to another? . Backend: . The backend creates endpoints that are used to edit the properties of the database constructed by the model. | Get, Post, Put, and Delete methods are used in order to define HTTP endpoints in the API. These endpoints are based on requests that can be made to change the database. | Variables defined in the model file are used to call data from the database in order to be manipulated. | . | . Methods in Backend Example . Modules are being imported with specified classes which are used later in the program. Blueprint: used to organize routes and functions | request: used to access data sent to the Flask app. through the HTTP request | Api: creates a Flask instance that handles requests | Resource: this allows for the definition of custom HTTP requests | reqparse: used to parse (sort and search) and validate data that is requested | . | The blueprint and api are then defined as variables and are used to store any future data that is requested. | Some preliminary functions, such as find_by_username, are created to be used later in the API code, allowing for simpler code. In this case, these functions are used to search through the database to find specific usernames. | . | . from flask import Blueprint, request from flask_restful import Api, Resource, reqparse # setting variables used to store future data leaderboard_bp = Blueprint(&quot;leaderboards&quot;, __name__) leaderboard_api = Api(leaderboard_bp) # pre-made function created to search for usernames, allows for simplified program def find_by_username(username): users = Leaderboard.query.filter_by(_username=username).all() return users[0] . GET Method . This method is used to fetch specific data points from the database by searching through the usernames. | This will be different for each type of database being made, however the general format stays the same. Since this is a text database, to pull specific information from the database, the API will search through the data using the username, which is unique. | The function defined previously, find_by_username(), is used to search through the database and pull the specific data point that is being searched. | If the user exists, the data of that user will be returned, being sent to the frontend of the program. | If a user isn&#39;t found, an error will be returned that the user does not exist. | . | In general, the program will always be searching for a piece of information that is unique and that will be used to pull data to wherever it is being requested. | . def get(self): # requested username turned into variable for later use username = request.get_json().get(&quot;username&quot;) print(username, &quot;uid&quot;) # username used to search for data and the found data is made into a variable user = find_by_username(username) if user: # data is sent to the frontend return user.to_dict() # error checking return {&quot;message&quot;: user}, 404 . POST Method . This method is used to add a specific piece of information in the database based on searching by usernames. | This is again different for each database that is made, however the general structure stays the same. In this example, a parser is being used to extract data from an incoming request. In this case, the RequestParser class is used from the Flask module. All required arguments are added to the parser, specifying what type of data it is. | The args variable is added in order to parse and store all incoming data. | . | The variable leaderboard is created to make a new object that will contain the values from the incoming data. | The function will attempt to add a new entry in the leaderboard database and return a status of a successful addition of the data. | If there is an error in the data being inputted, a status code of 500 will be returned. | . | . def post(self): # using parsers to gather and data that is to be posted and validate it&#39;s true parser = reqparse.RequestParser() parser.add_argument(&quot;username&quot;, required=True, type=str) parser.add_argument(&quot;password&quot;, required=True, type=str) parser.add_argument(&quot;pointsEasy&quot;, required=True, type=int) parser.add_argument(&quot;pointsMedium&quot;, required=True, type=int) parser.add_argument(&quot;pointsHard&quot;, required=True, type=int) # variable made to store data args = parser.parse_args() # variable created to format all data into one place and send to database for logging leaderboard = Leaderboard(args[&quot;username&quot;], args[&quot;password&quot;], args[&quot;pointsEasy&quot;], args[&quot;pointsMedium&quot;], args[&quot;pointsHard&quot;]) try: # data is sent to the database for storage db.session.add(leaderboard) db.session.commit() return leaderboard.to_dict(), 201 except Exception as e: # error checking db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . PUT Method . This method is used to update a specific piece of information in the database based on searching by usernames. | For each data base that is made, there will be different specific but the overall structure stays the same. First, the username variable is defined, which retrieves the requested username and sets it as a variable that will be used later to edit a specific dataset. | The function find_by_username() is again used to search through the data to look for the username requested. This is set to a variable to be used later. | If the username is found in the database, the rest of the dataset is updated with the new values requested. This is updated into the database. | If there is an error found with the data requested of it the user isn&#39;t found, an error is returned. | . | . def put(self): # variable created to make requested username into something that can be used to search for data in future username = request.get_json().get(&quot;username&quot;) print(username, &quot;uid&quot;) try: # attempts to find the data in the database user = find_by_username(username) if user: # if the data is found, the data points are updates user.pointsEasy = int(request.get_json().get(&quot;pointsEasy&quot;)) user.pointsMedium = int(request.get_json().get(&quot;pointsMedium&quot;)) user.pointsHard = int(request.get_json().get(&quot;pointsHard&quot;)) db.session.commit() return user.to_dict(), 201 else: # if user not found, error is returned return {&quot;message&quot;: &quot;leaderboard not found&quot;}, 404 except Exception as e: # checks for errors in request db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . DELETE Method . This method is used to delete a specific information from the database, again searching by username. | The overall structure stays the same between different databases, but the specific variables will need to be changed to personalize the database. A variable for the username is created in order to search for for the user name requested later in the code with the function find_by_username(). | If the user is found, the user is deleted, along with that user&#39;s data and the change is saved to the database. | If the user isn&#39;t found or if an error is found with the data requested, an error is returned. | . | . def delete(self): # username variable defined to store requested value username = request.get_json().get(&quot;username&quot;) print(username, &quot;uid&quot;) try: # finds the username and stores data in variable user = find_by_username(username) if user: # if the user is found, the user and their data is deleted db.session.delete(user) db.session.commit() return user.to_dict() else: # if user not found, error is returned return {&quot;message&quot;: &quot;leaderboard not found&quot;}, 404 except Exception as e: # error checking for request error db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . Displaying the Full Database . Another class is created in order to display the entire database at once and also to delete the entire database if necessary. | This uses the same functions as before to GET and DELETE the data, however it is modified slightly to look through the entire database abd display or delete all data points. | An example of where this would be useful is to create a table of data in the frontend. | . class LeaderboardListAPI(Resource): # GET method def get(self): try: # attempts to find the entire database requested and is stored in variable leaderboards = db.session.query(Leaderboard).all() # sends back the entire database return [leaderboard.to_dict() for leaderboard in leaderboards] except Exception as e: # error checking for request errors db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 # DELETE method def delete(self): try: # deletes entire database db.session.query(Leaderboard).delete() db.session.commit() return [] except Exception as e: # checks for errors in request db.session.rollback() return {&quot;message&quot;: f&quot;server error: {e}&quot;}, 500 . Popcorn Hacks . Please answer these questions to earn points for the popcorn hacks. . What are the four HTTP request methods that are used with Flask? GET, POST, PUT, DELETE | . | What is a parser and how would it be aid with data validation? A parser is used to extract data from an incoming request like json. It would aid with data validation by parsing and storing all incoming data. | . | What is the role endpoints in Flask? Endpoints are used to map a URl route when a user makes a request to that URL then it will be taken to the corresponding functions. | . | Frontend and How it Communicates to Backend . This first part of the frontend logic simply finds out of the site is running locally or not, off of which is figures out whether or not to pull data from the local backend link or the global backend link. In this example, a global backend link hasn&#39;t been sent, however it would go in the second set of quotations after the local address. This isn&#39;t something you need to know, but it is nice to use when developing full stack applications. . // checks if site is run locally const isLocalhost = Boolean( window.location.hostname === &quot;localhost&quot; || window.location.hostname === &quot;[::1]&quot; || window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?: .(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/) ) // defines database url const api = isLocalhost ? &quot;http://localhost:8200&quot; : &quot;&quot;; . GET Method . This method is more complicated in terms of requesting, simply because in order to, for example, print all data points into a table, the function needs to iterate through the entire database. | In this example, the function getList() is used to asynchronously fetch the entire database and set it to a variable called list. The list is returned for later use outside of this function in order to print the data. | . | . Printing the Data . In order to print the data, the function getList() is run and once it is run, it iterates through the data to pull out each individual data point and enter it into the function used to make the table. For each class in the database, which is each row in the database, the variables corresponding to that specific class are pulled and inserted into the addTask() function as parameters to create the table of users. | . | The function addTask() is used to create the visual table that the user sees. A row is created and for each table cell in that row, the data is added by iterating through the array of variables that are parameters pulled directly from the database. | A new row is added into table for each new class of information pulled from the database. | . | . // fetches entire database const getList = async () =&gt; { // stores it in variable list const list = await fetch(api + &quot;/leaderboardList&quot;).then((r) =&gt; r.json()); return list }; // goes through entire database and pulls each individual class getList().then(list =&gt; { // for each class (row), data is pulled and added into addTask() function to be put in visual table list.forEach(cls =&gt; { addTask(cls.username, cls.pointsEasy, cls.pointsMedium, cls.pointsHard) }) }) // adds visual representation of data in table function addTask(username, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard) { // array of variables defining data points var tableCells = [username, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard] // creates new row in variable var row = document.createElement(&#39;tr&#39;) // goes through entire data set and places data into cells for (var i = 0; i &lt; tableCells.length; i++) { var tableCell = document.createElement(&#39;th&#39;) tableCell.textContent = tableCells[i] tableCell.className = &#39;cell&#39; row.appendChild(tableCell) } // creates new row as child of schedule element schedule.appendChild(row) } . POST Method . This method is used to push data to the backend using the HTTP POST method. The function addData is defined with the parameters that are going to be pushed into the backend. | An object is created to define the variables that are going to be pushed into the backend. This is basically the JSON string that will be sent to the backend to get decoded and inserted into the database. | The fetch() function is called with the api variable, which is a variable representing the url for the backend API, and the extension specific to where the data will be posted, in this case being /leaderboard. The method, headers, and body of the data are defined in order to complete a successful HTTP request to the backend. The object data which was created earlier, is converted to a JSON string here and sent to the backend. | . | If an error is detected, it is returned and the request will fail. | . | . // calls addData function function addData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // creates object defining the variables that will be added to the backend, corresponding with the backend variables let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // POST method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;POST&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . PUT and DELETE Methods . These two methods are almost identical to the POST method above in the way they work, the only difference being that the method requested is different. The name of the function defined is also changes, in this case being editData() and deleteData(). | . // editing function defined function editData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // has object with variables that are required in backend let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // PUT method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;PUT&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . // deleting function defined function deleteData(username, password, pointsEasy, pointsMedium, pointsHard){ // object defined with variables that are same as backend let data = { &quot;username&quot;: username, &quot;password&quot;: password, &quot;pointsEasy&quot;: pointsEasy, &quot;pointsMedium&quot;: pointsMedium, &quot;pointsHard&quot;: pointsHard } // DELETE method called fetch(api + &#39;/leaderboard&#39;, { method: &#39;DELETE&#39;, headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, body: JSON.stringify(data), }) // error checking .then((response) =&gt; response.json()) .catch((error) =&gt; { console.error(&#39;Error:&#39;, error); }); } . Calling Images (GET Method) . The process for calling images is basically the same as anything else, except you need to be able to reconstruct the images based on the base64 that is requested from the backend. | In this case, the image in the api is being called to the frontend and is returned as the variable list. This is then inserted directly into the html by getting the element that needs to be edited and styling with css by using the built-in function data:image/png;base64, which translated from bytes to pixel. | . | . // GET method calling info from backend url const getList = async () =&gt; { const list = await fetch(api + &quot;/api/images/GetEasyImage&quot;).then((r) =&gt; r.json()); return list }; // inserting image into frontend getList().then(list =&gt; { document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;body&quot;)[0].style = &quot;background-image: url(&#39;data:image/png;base64, &quot; + list.bytes +&quot;&#39;);&quot; }) .

(mention JSON in your answer) | Time and Space Complexity of Algorithms . The lesson for time and space complexity of algorithms will consist of demonstrations of sorting algorithms and the different time complexities that they come with on a small scale. This can be acomplished using things such as a deck of cards or even with actual people. An example of how this will work is laying out the cards in a random order on the table, and demonstrating different ways of sorting it. From methods such as bubble sort to methods such as bogo sort, it will be really easy to see exactly how much time it would take for these different sorting algoritms to complete. Then after that, it is easy to understand the concept of time complexity when given a real world example. . Space complexity can be demonstrated by using the same method, however, adding in the extra step of having the cards in a pile. This will show how much space is needed to complete the sorting algorithm. This will easily reveal the concept of space complexity because it allows people to witness a real world, physical example of the concept, turning a really hard to grasp concept into something that is easy to understand. . Additionally, we are also going to analyze certain algorithms within our project to show how such analysis is applicable to real world projects. . Essential Question: What is the quicksort algorithm, and how does it work? How does it&#39;s time and space complexities scale with input sizes? . QuickSort Algorithm . The main algorithm we&#39;ve employed is an recursive implementation of quickSort in the backend to sort the database entries to obtain the user with the highest overall score. Typically this algorithm is implemented to sort in ascending order, but to make it easier to extract the top 10 users, we sill be modifying the algorithm to sort in descending order (so the top players show up first in the list). . class LeaderboardTop10(Resource): def partition(self, arr, lo, hi): pivot = arr[hi][1] # Pivot value set to the 2nd index of the last element pivot_pos = lo - 1 # Set our base pivot position, ensure that lower picoit index == lo for idx in range(lo, hi): # Iterate over all elements in the partition array if arr[idx][1] &gt;= pivot: # Found an element creater than pivot pivot_pos+=1 # Increment correct position for pivot arr[pivot_pos], arr[idx] = arr[idx], arr[pivot_pos] # Swap the larger element with the element at the current pivot position arr[pivot_pos + 1], arr[hi] = arr[hi], arr[pivot_pos + 1] # Swap element at pivot position with the pivot element return pivot_pos+1 # Return index of pivot element def qSortUserList(self, arr, lo, hi): if lo &lt; hi: last_pivot = self.partition(arr, lo, hi) self.qSortUserList(arr, lo, last_pivot-1) self.qSortUserList(arr, last_pivot+1, hi) def get(self): users_list = get_user_list() top10 = {} self.qSortUserList(users_list, 0, len(users_list)-1) for user in users_list: top10[user[0]] = user[1] print(top10) if len(top10) &lt;= 10: return top10 return top10[:10] . To understand how the algorithm first, we must first familiarize ourselves with the process. . Our backend grabs all users from our leaderboard | Returns all users and their scores in a 2-D array, each element is a list of length two that contains the username and cumulative score of the player | The sorting algorithm will use the second element representing the user score to sort the array of users. ┌─────────────────────┐ ┌──────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ Split │ │ display │ │ Database │ │ the ├──────────────► sorted list │ │ │ │ List into │ │ on endpoint │ │ │ │ top 10 users │ │ │ └──────────┬──────────┘ └─────────▲────────┘ └─────────────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ┌──────────▼──────────┐ ┌─────────┴────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ 2-D User Array │ │ QuickSort │ │ ├───────────────► │ │ [(username, score)] │ │ Algorithm │ │ │ │ │ └─────────────────────┘ └──────────────────┘ . Our quickSort algorithm consists of 2 procedures, a partition() procedure that pivots and sorts individual elements, and a qSortUserList() that performs recursion which finishes the sorting. | The Logic . The partition procedure will serve to &quot;partition&quot; our list into 2 parts, a smaller portion and a larger portion around a certain pivot value (Note: These portions don&#39;t have to sorted yet!). . Partition procedure . First, partition selects a certain element in a list to be a pivot. This pivot value will be used to make comparisons to every other value in the array. For simplicity, we have selected our pivot element as the last element in the unsorted list. The procedure defines a pivot_pos variable to denote the correct position of the pivot index after each iteration. Although it may seem weird that the variable intially starts with a value of 0-1 = -1, this negative index is resolved by the return statement, which always returns an index that&#39;s one higher than pivot_pos. This serves to ensure that the lowest pivot index would be 0, which is the smallest element in any given partition. . pivot = arr[hi][1] pivot_pos = lo - 1 . The partition will then iterate over each element in the list from the starting and ending indexes indicated by the parameters. if a particular value is found to be larger than the pivot, the algorithm well then increment the recorded pivot position and swap the pivot with the found element. . for idx in range(lo, hi): if arr[idx][1] &gt;= pivot: pivot_pos+=1 arr[pivot_pos], arr[idx] = arr[idx], arr[pivot_pos] . Finally, the partition procedure swaps the element at the pivot_pos+1 index with our pivot element at the hi index to place the pivot at it&#39;s rightful place. We know that pivot_pos+1 must be smaller than hi because it did not trigger the conditional to increment the `pivot_pos+1`` index. At last, the pivot_pos is incremented and returned to serve as an indicator of where our two partitions split. . arr[pivot_pos + 1], arr[hi] = arr[hi], arr[pivot_pos + 1] return pivot_pos+1 . qSort procedure . If the parition procedure splits our list into smaller and larger regions, then our qSort procedure ensures that these regions are in order. It&#39;s hard to explain, but the procedure iterates over each paritition, repeating the paritition process, setting new pivot values, and correctly places the pivot values at their correct sorted order. . The procedure first checks if the lower index is smaller than the higher index, to ensure that our parition has a length greater than 1. If this check passes, the procedure then calls the partition procedure to both split our list into the two distinct regions and also the index of our correctly placed pivot value. The procedure then invokes itself again on the larger interval (replacing hi to be the partition index-1 since the previous pivot is already sorted), and also on the smaller interval (replacing lo to be partition index+1). . Eventually, the qSort procedure will iterate through all elements in the list while parition places each element at the correct position, giving us the final sorted list. . Complexity analysis . To analyze time complexity, we must analyze the partition and qSort procedures. . For the qSort procedure, because we divide the array into 2 halves during each function call, our number of function calls scales proportionally to log(n), where n is the length of the input array. However, within each function call, we also call the partition procedure, which contains an for-loop that iterates over each element in the partioned array, comparing it to a pivot value. We are well familiar with since loops, and can safely say that runtime scales proportionally to the length of the partition array. Due to this, we can conclude that our iteration time complexity scales linearly. Thus for each iterative process, our timerun scales proportionally to n. . Finally, we could multiply our two complexities together to get a representation of our overall complexity. Thus, the asymptotic notation for a time complexity could be represented as O(nlogn), where n is the length of the input array. Keep in mind, Big-Oh notation is not a function that returns the accurate runtime for any given input, but rather only gives us a model to see how runtime scales with increasing input sizes. . Space complexity for this program is much easier to analyze. Because the array is sorted in-place (meaning we don&#39;t create other placeholders or copies), we require no additional space to sort this array. However, recursive function calls may require extra storage on the call stack. Since we found the number of recursive calls to be asymptotic to Olog(n), we can conclude that quickSort has an O(1) space complexity for an iterative method, and an O(logn) space complexity for a recursive method. . Popcorn Hack . Please answer our EQ for this section: What is the quicksort algorithm, and how does it work? How does it&#39;s time and space complexities scale with input sizes? . EQ: It&#39;s a sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort an array of elements. You select a &quot;pivot&quot; element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The time complexity of Quicksort is O(n log n). | . Hacks - Frontend and Backend . Please clone these two repositories: . Frontend | Backend | . Directions: .

            "content": "What is SASS? . Sass is a preprocessor language that&#39;s interpreted into CSS. A preprocessor language takes input data and converts it to an output that&#39;s used as input by another program. This means when you run Sass code, you&#39;re actually converting your code to CSS. That CSS code output is then used directly by a browser. Fun fact CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. . SCSS vs. CSS . Understanding the differences between SCSS and CSS . What is CSS . CSS is the default technology that most programmers use when styling webpage. It is one of the 3 fundamental web technologies along with HTML and JavaScript. HTML manages the structure, JavaScript makes pages interactive, and CSS changes the style by taking a markup language like HTML and describes how it should be presented to the user. . | However, CSS is not very easy to work with lacking a lot features often making using CSS very confusing and difficult or hard to work with on lengthy projects. This is why there are tools like Bootstrap, Sass, and Tailwind that make styling a lot easier and more efficient. We will be using Sass in this course. . | . CSS Example . This is an example of CSS that can be used to change body text of an HTML document | Hack Question:Can you guess what its changing style of the text to? | . body{ color: #0000FF; font-family: Ariel, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; } . What is SCSS . SCSS is short for Sassy Cascading Style Sheets. | SCSS very similar to CSS but the difference comes with the fact that SCSS extends the functionality of CSS while also making it simpler. What this allows us to do is it enables us to things like nested styling, functions, mixins, variables, inheritance (more on these later) and so on. | . Sass Code Example . $blue: #0000FF; body{ color: $blue; font-family: Ariel, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; } . This example is doing the same thing as the other code segment above but the difference being that here we defined the color as $blue which makes it much easier for us to recall later on. In fact, we have done this before, if you have been using the dark mode/midnight theme then go ahead and navigate your your _sass folder and check out the dark-mode.scss and you&#39;ll see something similar to the example above | . So which one is better to use? . CSS tends to be better for really simple styling where not many complex or nested styles are required and small projects that doesn&#39;t require a lot of customization. | SCSS on the other hand is very good for more complex styling and working with a project with more than one page where maybe lots of customization is needed. Such as the projects we made last and first trimester. | . Modular SCSS . Understanding how to use modular SCSS . Modular SCSS allows you to break multiple different files and then be able to compile them into a single CSS file | How do you do this? Well all you need to do is have _filenames.scss so that is compiled into its own file | Now after adding the to the file name you can import it into you file without the and all the styles will be carried over. | The benefits of a partial is that it allows you to big websites and allows you to break up the code in multiple components and easily make changes instead of having to go through a huge file. | All styles in the partial will be added and can be used into the main file as if they were defined in the main file. | . File 1 _variable.scss . $primary-button-color: #009494; $hover-color: black; $menu-color: #f2f2f2; . File 2 style.scss . We can see the importing of the .scss file&#39;s content into the other main .scss file style.scss | . {@import &#39;variables&#39;; @import &quot;{{ site.theme }}&quot;;} /* &quot;row style&quot; is flexible size and aligns pictures in center */ .row { align-items: center; display: flex; } /* &quot;column style&quot; is one-third of the width with padding */ .column { flex: 33.33%; padding: 5px; } .menu a { // float: left; display: block; color: $menu-color; text-align: center; // padding: 14px 16px; text-decoration: none; } .menu a:hover { background: $primary-button-color; color: $hover-color; } . Nesting . What is nesting? Where did the birds come from? . Nesting is a way to organize your code and make it easier to read. It also helps keep your code DRY (Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself). | Nesting is when you put one selector inside another selector. This is a great way to keep your code organized and make it easier to read. | When we make HTML we often nest different elements within each other and have a clear structure when we look at it. | The problem is that in regular CSS we don&#39;t have that so we need to use SASS to help us organize our code. | . Warning:Don&#39;t nest too much as when the CSS is processed it can make overqualified selectors which can be hard to read and maintain. Which means that it would only target that specific element type and not any other elements that have the same class name. ## Sass Nesting | Through nesting the ul, li, and a selectors within the nav selector makes your CSS better and increases its readability overall. | . nav { ul { margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style: none; } li { display: inline-block; } a { display: block; padding: 6px 12px; text-decoration: none; } } . CSS - Lack of Nesting . We can see that through the lack of nesting the CSS is not as organized and needs extra information to be able to make it more clear exactly what is being targeted. | . nav ul { margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style: none; } nav li { display: inline-block; } nav a { display: block; padding: 6px 12px; text-decoration: none; } . Variables . What is a variable? . A variable is a container that stores information so for instance when you multiple places that refer to one value you can just use the variable name instead of the value. | This is valuable in SASS because it allows you to reuse that value in multiple places throughout you stylesheet. | Variables in CSS preprocessors such as Sass allow you to store information that you can reuse in your stylesheet, such as font stacks, colors, or any other CSS value you anticipate needing. The $ symbol is used in Sass to designate a variable. | . Pro Tip:The reason SASS variables are better than variables in regular CSS is that they are more consider and easier to read with a much simpler syntax. Fun Fact: Variables in SASS came before CSS and often SASS has features long before they are actually added to CSS as a whole. . Variable Example Syntax . $variable-name: value; | Once the sass is processed the variable name is replaced with the value throughout the program. | . $main-font: Calibri, sans-serif; $main-color: #000; $main-color-hover: #000; . Operators . Operators are used to perform operations on variables and other aspects of the language like in python we can use operators to see if values are equal, add, divide, subtract, multiply, etc. | SASS has a lot of operators that can be used to perform operations on variables and other aspects of the language as well. They can include == to check if two values are equal and != to check if two values are not equal | + to add two values together | - to subtract two values | * to multiply two values | / to divide two values | % to find the remainder of two values | &lt; to check if one value is less than another | &gt; to check if one value is greater than another | &lt;= to check if one value is less than or equal to another | &gt;= to check if one value is greater than or equal to another | Also there is and, or, &amp; not to be able to use boolean operations | . | . Operator Example Syntax . Operators are used in this example to perform string concatenation | . // Html &lt;p id=&quot;testing&quot;&gt;original text and&lt;/p&gt; // SASS #testing:after{ content: &quot; some&quot; + &quot; more&quot; + &quot; text&quot;; } // Output original text and some more text . Conditional Statements . There are conditional statements in SASS just like in Python and JavaScript they work the same way as well. | Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Such as if a certain condition is true then do this, if it is false then do that and so on. | SASS has @if which allows for different styles based on if a boolean expression was true or false. | SASS has @else which allows for different set of styles if the if condition was not met or false. | SASS has @else if which allows for an alternative conditions to be run if the first is not met. | . $color: red; button { @if $color == red { background-color: $color; } } // @else: allows you to provide an alternative set of styles to apply if the condition in the @if statement isn&#39;t met $color: blue; button { @if $color == red { background-color: red; } @else { background-color: $color; } } // @else if: allows you to provide multiple alternative conditions to test $color: green; button { @if $color == red { background-color: red; } @else if $color == blue { background-color: blue; } @else { background-color: $color; } } . Loops In Sass . Loops are present in SASS through the @for and @while decorators, along with @each. | Loops are used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times or until a certain condition is met just like in any other programming language. . For Loops: Are used to iterate through a value like a list or a range of numbers | While Loops: Are used to iterate through a block of code until a certain condition is met such as a value is being equal to a certain value through an incrementing or decrementing a variable or any other condition that is met. | . | When using while loops they can be necessary but it is better to use @each and @for as it will make it clear and be able to compile faster. . | Side Note: In SASS lists care a any group of values that are separated by a comma or a space there is no special brackets used like in python or javascript. Lists can be searched for values however they are immutable meaning that they cannot be changed once they are created. . | . Some Code Examples of Loops and Lists . // A for each loop is used to interact with a group of sizes changing // the size of the element for each item in the list $sizes: 40px, 50px, 80px; @each $size in $sizes { .icon-#{$size} { font-size: $size; height: $size; width: $size; } } // @each: allows you to loop over a list of values and generate styles $colors: red, green, blue; @each $color in $colors { .color-#{$color} { background-color: $color; } } . @debug list.index(1px solid red, 1px); // 1 @debug list.index(1px solid red, solid); // 2 @debug list.index(1px solid red, dashed); // null . @use &quot;sass:math&quot;; /// Divides `$value` by `$ratio` until it&#39;s below `$base`. @function scale-below($value, $base, $ratio: 1.618) { @while $value &gt; $base { $value: math.div($value, $ratio); } @return $value; } $normal-font-size: 16px; sup { font-size: scale-below(20px, 16px); } . $base-color: #036; @for $i from 1 through 3 { ul:nth-child(3n + #{$i}) { background-color: lighten($base-color, $i * 5%); } } // @for: allows you to loop over a range of values and generate styles @for $i from 1 through 3 { .item-#{$i} { width: 100px * $i; } } . Functions in SASS . What is a function? . A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. This is a great method to be able to reuse code and processes in a manner that is more efficient and allows for the reuse of code. We do this all the time in programming languages such as JavaScript and Python. | . SASS functions . Sass Functions allow you to define complex calculations and transformations that can be used throughout your stylesheet and allow you to perform complex operations on values, manipulate data, plus you can generate content dynamically. . | There a are built in functions and ones you can make on your own like languages such as JavaScript and Python. . | SASS functions can be used to perform arithmetic operations, manipulate colors, work with strings, and more. . | Functions in SASS are similar to functions in programming languages, but they can be used within SASS stylesheets to generate CSS code dynamically. . | . Using Built-in Functions . Like Python and Javascript SASS provides a variety of built-in functions for math, color manipulation, string manipulation, and more. | . Math Functions . SASS has many functions that allow you to be able to perform wide range of math operations similar to the ones present in python including more complex operations. | . .round(1.2); // returns 1 .ceil(1.2); // returns 2 .floor(1.2); // returns 1 .abs(-1.2); // returns 1.2 .min(1, 2, 3); // returns 1 .max(1, 2, 3); // returns 3 .random(1, 100); // returns a random number between 1 and 100 . Color Functions . Color is an important component of any website and SASS provides a wide range of functions that allow you to manipulate colors in a variety of ways. | . .lighten(#007fff, 20%); // returns a lighter shade of blue .darken(#007fff, 20%); // returns a darker shade of blue .opacify(#007fff, 0.2); // makes the color more opaque .transparentize(#007fff, 0.2); // makes the color more transparent .mix(#007fff, #ff0000, 50%); // returns a mix of two colors . String Functions . SASS provides a variety of string functions that allow you to manipulate strings. Here are some examples: | . .to-upper-case(&quot;hello world&quot;); // returns &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot; .to-lower-case(&quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;); // returns &quot;hello world&quot; .str-index(&quot;hello world&quot;, &quot;world&quot;); // returns the index of the first occurrence of &quot;world&quot; .str-insert(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot; world&quot;, 5); // inserts &quot; world&quot; into &quot;hello&quot; at position 5 . Creating Custom Functions . In addition to using built-in functions, you can also create your own functions in SASS using the @function name(arguments){} | @return is similar to the return statement in JavaScript and Python. It returns a value from a function. | Functions take input values, perform calculations, and return a result. Here&#39;s an example of a simple function that calculates the area of a rectangle: | . @function rectangle-area($width, $height) { @return $width * $height; } // Usage: $area: rectangle-area(10px, 20px); // Returns 200px . Or you can also make a different kind of function that increases the font size to the factorial of a inputted number. | . @function factorial($number){ $calculated: 1; @for $_ from 1 through $number { $calculated: $calculated*$number; } @return $calculated; } #testing { font-size: factorial(3); } . //Combining functions and loops to achieve different sass effects @function sum($numList){ $sum: 0; @each $num in $numList { $sum: $sum+$num; } @return $num; } @function tri($num){ $sum: 0; @for $i from 1 through $num { $sum: $sum+$num; } @return $sum; } @function max($nums){ $i:0; $value:0px; @while $i&lt;length($nums){ @if $value&lt;list.nth($nums,$i){ $value:list.nth($nums,$i); } } } . Custom functions are very powerful, and can be used to create reusable pieces of code that can be used throughout your stylesheets. . | SASS functions are a powerful feature that allow you to perform complex operations on values, manipulate data, and generate content dynamically. By using built-in functions and creating your own custom functions, you can greatly extend the capabilities of your SASS stylesheets. . | . Mixins . Mixin what is a mix in what are we mixing in? . Mixins are a way to make groups of CSS that you want to reuse throughout your site anywhere you please. | Mixins are a form of template and that you can use to build on top of to make different features later on this prevents you from having to write the same code over and over again. | This is a form of encapsulation in your CSS and is a great way to make your code more organized and easier to read. | Mixins can also take in arguments and be able to be used to apply effects on certain elements if that is a feature you want to add to your site. However unlike functions which also take arguments mixins cannot return values. | To use a mixin declare it with @mixin and then incorporate with @include. | . Inheritance . What is inheritance? . In general programming concept where the child class can inherit properties from the parent class. These properties can be changed and modified in the child class. This prevents code from being repeated and makes the code more usable and flexible. | In SASS we have a similar concept that can be used as well we can create base styles and then have other styles inherit from them and then we can change them as we please. | We can do that by through using @extend .name-of-class and then we can add more styles to it as we please. Simple as that | . Mixin &amp; Inheritance Code Example . // example of @mixin @mixin button { width: auto; height: auto; border-radius: 10px; background-color: #21807c; border: 3px solid black; font-size: 1.5em; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; grid-column: span 1; grid-row: span 1; // creates smooth animation effect transition: all 0.5s; } // default button theme for calculator and stopwatch buttons. Both will follow the same button format .button { // uses the scss from the @mixin @include button; } /* styling for the calculator clear button */ .calculator-button-clear { // @extend inherits .button and then changes the background color from .button @extend .button; background-color: #e68b1c; } /* styling for the calculator equals button */ .calculator-button-equals { // another @extend inherits .button and then changes the background color from .button @extend .button; background-color: #e70f0f; } .

            "title": "Big Idea 2 - Data Related to User Guide",
            "content": "Introduction . When building an application that requires users to create accounts or sign in, handling data related to users is crucial. This data can include things like user profiles, preferences, and activity logs, which can be used to personalize the user experience and improve the application&#39;s performance. . By learning how to handle data related to users effectively and efficiently, you&#39;ll be equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to build helpful applications that meet the needs of your users. . PLEASE DON&#39;T OPEN THE POPCORN HACKS, WE WILL OPEN THEM DURING THE PRESENTATION . Basics of Class and User Data . Establishing Class/User Data and making a new user . Because Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, everything in it represents an object. Lists, dictionaries, functions, etc. are all examples of Python objects. Generally speaking, a Python object is an entity of data items and methods describing the behavior of those items. . A Python class is a template used to create Python objects. We can think of it as a cooking recipe, where all the ingredients and their quantities are listed, and the whole process of cooking is described step-by-step. . In this case, we can compare a cake recipe to a class, and a cake cooked following that recipe to an object (i.e., an instance of that class). Using the same recipe (class), we can create many cakes (objects). This is the essence of creating a class in Python: to define data elements and the rules establishing how these elements can interact and change their state — and then use this framework to build various objects in a set way, instead of creating them from scratch every time. . Let&#39;s look at a few examples: . class Bikes: name = &quot;&quot; gear = 0 # create objects of class bike1 = Bikes() # objectName = ClassName() bike2 = Bikes() . Now that we have our class and object defined, we can now run code to modify certain attributes of our objects. . bike1.gear = 11 bike1.name = &quot;Mountain Bike&quot; bike2.gear = 13 bike2.name = &quot;Road Bike&quot; print(f&quot;Name: {bike1.name}, Gears: {bike1.gear} &quot;) . Name: Mountain Bike, Gears: 11 . Popcorn Hacks #1: Add another print command to display the attributes of Bike #2. What output will this code segment produce? print(f&#39;Name {bike2.name}, Gears: {bike2.gear}&#39;) . Name Road Bike, Gears: 13 . Example: Defining a User Class . Now we will look into Classes for users of a program or website. . class User: def __init__(self, username, email): self.username = username self.email = email def display_info(self): print(f&quot;Username: {self.username}, Email: {self.email}&quot;) . For this cell, we define a User class with a constructor method &quot;init&quot; that takes username and email as attributes. The display_info method is used to print the user information. . For backend functionality, this class can be used to create, manipulate, and manage user data. For example, when a new user signs up for an account, you could create a new User object with their username and email. This object can then be used to perform various operations, such as validating the user&#39;s input, storing the user&#39;s data in a database, or processing user-related requests. . Now let&#39;s make a new User: . new_user = User(&quot;jeffrey&quot;, &quot;leejeffreysc@gmail.com&quot;) new_user.display_info() . Username: jeffrey, Email: leejeffreysc@gmail.com . Here&#39;s a step-by-step breakdown of how the code relates to backend functionality: . new_user = User(&quot;jeffrey&quot;, &quot;leejeffreysc@gmail.com&quot;): This line creates a new User object, initializing it with the username &quot;jeffrey&quot; and the email &quot;leejeffreysc@gmail.com&quot;. This could represent a user who has just signed up for an account, and the input values would typically come from user input, such as a frontend signup form. . new_user.display_info(): This line calls the display_info method on the new_user object, which prints the user&#39;s information (username and email) to the console. In a real-world backend application, you might use this method or a similar one to display user information in logs, send a welcome email, or create an API response with the user&#39;s data. . User/Class @ Decorators: . A Python Class allows for the use of @ decorators, these allow access to attribute data without the use of functions. . @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to &quot;GET&quot; attribute data in a clean method (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to &quot;UPDATE&quot;/set attribute data in a clean method (object.name = &quot;Jeffrey&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;Jeffrey&quot;)) | . The getter and setter methods provide a clean and controlled way to access and modify the attributes of an object. This can be particularly useful when interacting with databases, APIs, or other parts of a web application that require the management and manipulation of object attributes. . class Student: def __init__(self, student, name): self._student = student self._name = name @property def name(self): return self._name @name.setter def name(self, new_name): self._name = new_name . In this example, the Student class has a name attribute, which is accessed and modified through the name property getter and setter methods. The _name attribute uses an underscore prefix, which is a convention to indicate it should not be accessed directly. . Usage of the getter and setter methods are below: . student = Student(1001, &quot;Derek Sol&quot;) print(student.name) # Get the name using the getter method student.name = &quot;Jagger Klein&quot; # Set the name using the setter method print(student.name) . Derek Sol Jagger Klein . Popcorn Hacks #2: The following code segment for computers does not have getter and setter methods called. Using the missing attributes &quot;model&quot; and &quot;year&quot;, add example getter and setters methods for this class. Show us an example output that this code segment might produce. class Computer: def __init__(self, model, year): self._model = model self._year = year @property def model(self): return self._model @model.setter def model(self, new_model): self._model = new_model @property def year(self): return self._year @year.setter def year(self, new_year): self._year = new_year . Chromebook = Computer(&quot;Chromebook&quot;, 2021) print(Chromebook.model) Chromebook.model = &quot;Macbook&quot; print(Chromebook.model) . Chromebook Macbook . Databases and SQLite . A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, manipulation, and management of that data. In other words, a database is a software application that allows you to store and manage large amounts of data in an organized manner. . Some Examples of Databases: . Storing and managing customer data, such as contact information, order history, and customer preferences. | Keeping track of inventory levels and stock movements in a warehouse or retail store. | Managing financial transactions, such as payments, invoices, and receipts. | . SQLite is a software library that provides a user-friendly database management system. Unlike other databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, SQLite is programmed within an application, which means it does not require a separate server process to operate. This makes SQLite great for web applications or for use in situations where you don&#39;t need a full database server. . In this lesson, we will be demonstrating how to set up a SQLite database in Flask, a Python web framework. Flask allows programmers to easily interact with SQLite databases, and we&#39;ll walk through the process of setting up a new database, creating tables, and adding data. We&#39;ll also cover some basic SQL commands that you can use to interact with your database, including CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. . Setting up a SQLite database in Flask . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;database.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE students (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, grade INTEGER)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . Note: This will create a new file &#39;database.db&#39; in the _notebooks folder if one doesn&#39;t exist. . Breaking down this code segment: . We imported the necessary libraries and tools | We created a Flask application | We connected to the SQLite database using SQLite3 | We created a cursor object to execute SQL commands | We created tables in the database using SQL commands | . Flask provides several extensions and tools for working with SQLite databases, including Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-SQLite3, and Flask-Admin. These tools provide a high-level interface for interacting with the database, making it easy to perform common operations such as adding, updating, and deleting records. . CRUD Commands with SQLite . CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the basic operations you can perform on data. SQL is useful library because it allows programmers to create new tables to organize data, add new data to a table, update data that&#39;s already there, or delete data that&#39;s no longer needed. . C: To create a new record in a database, you must first define the table structure that will store the data. This can be accomplished using SQL commands such as CREATE. Once the table is created, data can be added to it using the INSERT INTO command. . | R: To retrieve data from the database, you can use the READ command. You can specify which fields you want to retrieve and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. There are also several functions available to aggregate and manipulate data. . | U: To modify existing data in the database, you can use the UPDATE command. You will need to specify which table and fields you want to update, and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. . | D: To remove data from the database, you can use the DELETE command. . | . Example of CRUD within an SQLite Database . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;database.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE basketball (_player TEXT PRIMARY KEY, _team TEXT, _position TEXT, _opinion TEXT)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . Hypothetically, our programmer wanted to create an application about basketball players, and created a new table in SQL to store and interact with user-submitted data. Using the same method as the previous table, a new table &#39;basketball&#39; is created by the cursor and added to the &#39;database.db&#39; file. . Create Function: . def create(): database = &#39;database.db&#39; player = input(&quot;Enter the player name&quot;) team = input(&quot;Enter team name&quot;) position = input(&quot;Enter player position&quot;) opinion = input(&quot;Enter your opinion &quot;) # Connecting to the database, create cursor to execute the SQL command connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Execute SQL to insert record in to db cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO basketball (_player, _team, _position, _opinion) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (player, team, position, opinion)) # Commit the changes connection.commit() print(f&quot;New basketball with {player} is added.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while inserting record&quot;, error) # Closing cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() create() . New basketball with jaquis is added. . The create() feature allows users to input information about a basketball player and store it in a SQLite table &#39;basketball&#39; inside the database file we already created &#39;database.db&#39;. The code prompts the user for the player&#39;s name, team name, position, and their opinion about the player, then establishes a connection to the SQLite database and creates a cursor object for executing SQL commands. . The cursor.execute() method is called with an SQL INSERT command to insert a new entry into the &#39;basketball&#39; table. The connection.commit() method saves the changes to the database, and if the record is inserted successfully, a confirmation message is printed. In case of errors, the except block catches the sqlite3.Error exception and prints an error message. Finally, the cursor and the connection to the database are closed, and the create() function is called to execute the code. . Read Function: . def read(): database = &#39;database.db&#39; # Connecting to the database, create cursor to execute the SQL command connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() # Fetch all the records from basketball table results = cursor.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM basketball&#39;).fetchall() if len(results) != 0: for row in results: print(row) else: print(&quot;No player found.&quot;) # Closing cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() read() . (&#39;jaquis&#39;, &#39;dogeBois&#39;, &#39;69420&#39;, &#39;Fantastic&#39;) . The read() feature retrieves and prints all entries from the &#39;basketball&#39; table in the specified SQLite database. The script establishes a connection to the SQLite database, creates a cursor object for executing SQL commands, and calls the cursor.execute() method with an SQL SELECT command to fetch all the entires from the &#39;basketball&#39; table. The fetchall() method retrieves all the rows returned by the SELECT command and stores them in the results variable. . The code then checks if there are any records in the table and, if so, iterates through each row in the results using a &#39;for loop&#39; and prints the row. If there are no records, the program prints &quot;No player found&quot;. Finally, the cursor and the connection to the database are closed, and the read() function is called to execute the code. . Update Function: . import sqlite3 def update(): database = &#39;database.db&#39; player = input(&quot;Enter a basketball player to update the opinion for:&quot;) opinion = input(&quot;Enter new opinion:&quot;) # Connecting to the database, create cursor to execute the SQL command connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Updating review for the basketball cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE basketball SET _opinion = ? WHERE _player = ?&quot;, (opinion, player)) if cursor.rowcount != 0: print(f&quot;Review for the basketball is updated to {opinion}&quot;) connection.commit() else: print(f&quot;Player not found.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error occurred&quot;, error) # Closing cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() update() . Review for the basketball is updated to stricking . This update feature updates the opinion for a specific basketball player in an SQLite database. The code defines an update() function, which prompts the user to input the basketball player they want to update and the new opinion for that player. The script connects to the SQLite database, creates a cursor object, and handles any potential errors while executing the SQL command. The cursor.execute() method updates the review in the database for the specified basketball item. . If at least one value is changed, a success message is printed and the changes are committed to the database. Otherwise, a &quot;Player not found.&quot; message is displayed. In the except block, if an error occurs, an error message along with specific error details is printed. Finally, the cursor and connection to the database are closed, and the update() function is called to execute the review update process. . Delete Function . import sqlite3 def delete(): database = &#39;database.db&#39; player = input(&quot;Enter basketball player to delete&quot;) # Connecting to the database, create cursor to execute the SQL command connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM basketball WHERE _player = ?&quot;, (player,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: print(f&quot;{player} does not exist&quot;) else: print(f&quot;Successfully deleted basketball player {player}&quot;) connection.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error occurred: &quot;, error) # Closing cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() delete() . Successfully deleted basketball player jaquis . The delete feature deletes a specific basketball player from the specified SQLite database. The code defines a delete() function that prompts the user to input the basketball player they want to delete. After connecting to the SQLite database and creating a cursor object, the code handles potential errors while executing the SQL command. The cursor.execute() method is used to delete the basketball item with the specified ID. . If no rows are affected, a message is printed indicating that the basketball player does not exist. Otherwise, a success message is displayed, confirming the basketball player&#39;s deletion. The changes are then committed to the database. In the except block, any error that occurs triggers an error message along with specific error details. Finally, the cursor and connection to the database are closed, and the delete() function is called to execute the basketball item deletion process. This code showcases a practical way to remove information from an SQLite database based on user input. . Menu Functions: . Alongside the four CRUD functions, a menu function is designed to manage Create, Read, Update, Delete operations and display the schema. The menu function is responsible for taking in user inputs and making the program call various functions. When running a menu function, users enter their desired operation, whether it be Create, Read, Update, or Delete, and the input is checked by various conditions to determine which function should be called. Many menu functions are called recursively, so the cell will repeat the menu process until the user decides to exit. . Popcorn Hacks #3: The menu function below is missing some of the CRUD functions for the specified basketball players table. Fix the following code by adding the intended CRUD functions, then perform a READ function on the database. def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . New basketball with jaquis is added. (&#39;jaquis&#39;, &#39;DogeBois&#39;, &#39;69420&#39;, &#39;Awesome&#39;) Review for the basketball is updated to terrible Successfully deleted basketball player jaquis . Image Uploading with SQLite . Using various Python Libraries, we are able to upload and customize images using python code, as well as using images to interact with databases. . One way to store images in a database is to INSERT the image data as a binary blob. . To store an image as a blob in SQLite, you can first read the image file and convert it to a binary format using a programming language like Python. Here&#39;s an example of how to do this: . Making the Table to store our Image Data: . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;database.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE images (name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, data BLOB)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . We use a new data type &quot;BLOB&quot; to store specific data from our .jpg image. . Adding Image Data to our Table: . You can use this example sunset jpg for our code. Download and place it in the same repository as this notebook. Rename image to &#39;image.jpg&#39; . https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/01/04/78/75/360_F_104787586_63vz1PkylLEfSfZ08dqTnqJqlqdq0eXx.jpg . import sqlite3 # Open a connection to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;database.db&#39;) # Read the image file as binary data with open(&#39;image.jpg&#39;, &#39;rb&#39;) as jpg: image_data = jpg.read() # Insert the image data into the database conn.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO images (name, data) VALUES (?, ?)&quot;, (&#39;image&#39;, image_data)) # Commit the transaction conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . In this example, the image data is read from the &quot;image.jpg&quot; file and inserted into the &quot;images&quot; table in the &quot;database.db&quot; SQLite database. The image data is then stored as a binary blob in the &quot;data&quot; column of the table. . Converting BLOB to Image -&gt; Displaying Image . import sqlite3 from PIL import Image import io # Open a connection to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;database.db&#39;) # Retrieve the image data from the database result = conn.execute(&quot;SELECT data FROM images WHERE name=?&quot;, (&#39;image&#39;,)).fetchone() # Convert the binary data to an image object image_data = io.BytesIO(result[0]) image = Image.open(image_data) # Display the image image.show() # Close the connection conn.close() . The image data is then retrieved from the &quot;images&quot; table using a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause that correctly matches the image name. The binary image data is then converted to an image object using the PIL library and displayed on the screen. . Popcorn Hacks #4: Using the same table, find a new .jpg image and add its image data to the database. Display the image using the PIL Library and show us the output image. import sqlite3 # Open a connection to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;database.db&#39;) # Read the image file as binary data with open(&#39;images/red_doggo.jpg&#39;, &#39;rb&#39;) as jpg: image_data = jpg.read() # Insert the image data into the database conn.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO images (name, data) VALUES (?, ?)&quot;, (&#39;doge&#39;, image_data)) # Commit the transaction conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . import sqlite3 from PIL import Image import io # Open a connection to the SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;database.db&#39;) # Retrieve the image data from the database result = conn.execute(&quot;SELECT data FROM images WHERE name=?&quot;, (&#39;doge&#39;,)).fetchone() # Convert the binary data to an image object image_data = io.BytesIO(result[0]) image = Image.open(image_data) # Display the image image.show() # Close the connection conn.close() .

Understand how computers can be used to represent real-world phenomena or outcomes | Compare simulations with real-world contexts. | Implement code to mimic real world situations, problems, or phenomena. | What are simulations by College Board definition? . Simulations are abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real world Purposes include drawing inferences without the constraints of the real world | . | Simulations use varying sets of values to reflect the the changing state of a real phenomenon | Often, when developing a simulation, it is necessary to remove specific details or simplify aspects Simulations can often contain bias based on which details or real-world elements were included/excluded | . | Simulations allow the formulation of hypothesis under consideration | Variability and randomness of the world is considered using random number generators | Examples: rolling dice, spinners, molecular models, analyze chemicals/reactions... | . . Analyzing an Example: Air-Traffic Simulator . Say we want to find out what the optimal number of aircrafts that can be in the air in one area is. | A simulation allows us to explore this question without real world contraints of money, time, safety Unfortunately we can&#39;t just fly 67 planes all at once and see what happens | . | Since the simulation won&#39;t be able to take all variables into control, it may have a bias towards one answer | Will not always have the same result | . Functions we often need (python) . import random # a module that defines a series of functions for generating or manipulating random integers random.choice() #returns a randomly selected element from the specified sequence random.choice(mylist) # returns random value from list random.randint(0,10) #randomly selects an integer from given range; range in this case is from 0 to 10 random.random() #will generate a random float between 0.0 to 1. . Functions we often need (js) . // Math.random(); returns a random number // Math.floor(Math.random() * 10); // Returns a random integer from 0 to 9: . College Board Question 1 . Question: The following code simulates the feeding of 4 fish in an aquarium while the owner is on a 5-day trip: . numFish ← 4 foodPerDay ← 20 foodLeft ← 160 daysStarving ← 0 REPEAT 5 TIMES { foodConsumed ← numFish * foodPerDay foodLeft ← foodLeft - foodConsumed IF (foodLeft &lt; 0) { daysStarving ← daysStarving + 1 } . } . This simulation simplifies a real-world scenario into something that can be modeled in code and executed on a computer. | Summarize how the code works: The code sets a variable for the amount of fish the amount of food they eat and the amount that is left to see in a span of 5 days how much food will be left or if they will starve and for how long. | .

Here we initialize the total population to be 50, then set the growth factor as 1.00005 (.005 percent change). It will print the population every 56th day until it reaches one million. It multiplies the current population by the growth factor in each iteration, and increments the day count. When the day count reaches 56, it prints the current population and resets the day count to 0. . Note! This simulation assumes that the growth factor remains constant as time progresses, which may not be a realistic assumption in real-world scenarios. . import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Define the initial population and growth rate population = 100 growth_rate = 0.05 # Define the number of years to simulate num_years = 50 # Create lists to store the population and year values populations = [population] years = [0] # Simulate population growth for the specified number of years for year in range(1, num_years+1): # Calculate the new population size new_population = population + (growth_rate * population) # Update the population and year lists populations.append(new_population) years.append(year) # Set the new population as the current population for the next iteration population = new_population # Plot the population growth over time plt.plot(years, populations) plt.xlabel(&#39;Year&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;Population&#39;) plt.title(&#39;Population Growth Simulation&#39;) plt.show() .

Simulation . A Clothing Store Simulation where users buy clothes which match their preferences . Real World Scenario . This mimics a real world scenario where a store owner can see if their inventory will sell to a random assortment of customers for their large amount of preferences that the user has for the things they want to buy that may be in their store. This could allow the store to make better purchase decisions or see if their inventory will sell. | . Bias in Simulation . The issues in the simulation are that the users&#39; preferences will not always have their choices determined from the inventory in the store so they may have a brand they like that isn&#39;t in the store or a price etc. Also the user can make compromises on their preferences so they may not always buy the things they want but are ok with buying which will make the amount of purchases artificially low. So in real life there will be more purchases than in the simulation also the customer may see something that they didn&#39;t know they wanted and buy it which is not accounted for in the simulation or they might buy more things than just one of their preferred product. | . Questions . A theme park wants to create a simulation to determine how long it should expect the wait time at its most popular ride. Which of the following characteristics for the virtual patrons would be most useful? Select two answers . A &amp; B as a user&#39;s ride and the distance they are willing to walk indicates the ride they want to ride and the more user&#39;s want to ride a ride the longer the wait time will be. | . | A programmer has created a program that models the growth of foxes and rabbits. Which of the following potential aspects of the simulation does NOT need to be implemented? . A as the other options indicate how many rabbits they are how much grass they eat per day is not a valuable piece of information to know for the simulation. | . | The heavy use of chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) has caused damage to the Earth’s ozone layer, creating a noticeable hole over Antarctica. A scientist created a simulation of the hole in the layer using a computer, which models the growth of the hole over many years. Which of the following could be useful information that the simulation could produce? . B as the simulation models the growth of the hole over many years and so it would allow for one to be able to solve for the size at any given point in time | . | A program is being created to simulate the growth of a brain-based on randomly determined environmental factors. The developer plans to add a feature that lets the user quickly run several hundred simulations with any number of factors kept constant. Why would this be useful? Select two answers. . (B &amp; D) B is a correct answer as it allows for variables to isolated and thus be able to see their effects on the rest of the program &amp; D is also correct as it would make it so that the user can generate a simulation that is specific to testing a certain variable and make it more detailed and make better conclusions. | . | Which of the following statements describes a limitation of using a computer simulation to model a real-world object or system? . C as every single attribute cannot possibly be represented in a computer program as there are just too many factors in the real world for a simulation to be 100% accurate it can only allow for a general idea of what the real world scenario would be like. | . | . import random import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Defines the classes and their attributes class ClothingShopper: def __init__(self, preferred_brand, preferred_size, preferred_color, preferred_price, preferred_style): self.preferred_brand = preferred_brand self.preferred_size = preferred_size self.preferred_color = preferred_color self.preferred_price = preferred_price self.preferred_style = preferred_style class ClothingItem: def __init__(self, brand, size, color, price, style): self.brand = brand self.size = size self.color = color self.price = price self.style = style # Match function to see if the shopper&#39;s preferences match the item if it does sim will say they bought it def is_match(self, shopper): return (self.style == shopper.preferred_style and self.brand == shopper.preferred_brand and self.size == shopper.preferred_size and self.color == shopper.preferred_color and self.price &lt;= shopper.preferred_price) def simulate_shopping(products, num_users): purchases_by_brand = {} revenue_by_brand = {} no_purchases = 0 for i in range(num_users): # randomly generate shopper preferences preferred_brand = random.choice(list(set([p.brand for p in products]))) preferred_size = random.choice([&quot;S&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;L&quot;]) preferred_color = random.choice([&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, &quot;white&quot;]) preferred_price = random.randint(10, 100) preferred_style = random.choice([&quot;casual&quot;, &quot;formal&quot;, &quot;sporty&quot;]) shopper = ClothingShopper(preferred_brand, preferred_size, preferred_color, preferred_price, preferred_style) # check if any products match shopper preferences matches = [] for p in products: if p.is_match(shopper): matches.append(p) # make a purchase if a match is found if matches: purchase = random.choice(matches) brand = purchase.brand if brand in purchases_by_brand: purchases_by_brand[brand] += 1 revenue_by_brand[brand] += purchase.price else: purchases_by_brand[brand] = 1 revenue_by_brand[brand] = purchase.price else: no_purchases += 1 # print out results print(&quot;Purchases by brand:&quot;) for brand, total_purchases in purchases_by_brand.items(): print(f&quot;{brand}: {total_purchases} purchases&quot;) print(f&quot;No purchases made for {no_purchases} shoppers out of {num_users} total shoppers.&quot;) # create bar chart for purchases by brand brands = list(purchases_by_brand.keys()) values = list(purchases_by_brand.values()) no_purchase_value = no_purchases brands.append(&quot;No purchase&quot;) values.append(no_purchase_value) fig = plt.figure(facecolor=&#39;white&#39;) plt.bar(brands, values) plt.title(&quot;Purchases by brand&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Brand&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Purchases&quot;) plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha=&#39;right&#39;) plt.show() # create bar chart for revenue by brand brands = list(revenue_by_brand.keys()) values = list(revenue_by_brand.values()) total_revenue = sum(values) brands.append(&quot;Total revenue&quot;) values.append(total_revenue) fig = plt.figure(facecolor=&#39;white&#39;) plt.bar(brands, values) plt.title(&quot;Revenue by brand&quot;) plt.xlabel(&quot;Brand&quot;) plt.ylabel(&quot;Revenue&quot;) plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha=&#39;right&#39;) plt.show() products = [ ClothingItem(&quot;Nike&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, 50, &quot;sporty&quot;), ClothingItem(&quot;Adidas&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, 30, &quot;sporty&quot;), ClothingItem(&quot;Levi&#39;s&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, 70, &quot;casual&quot;), ClothingItem(&quot;Gap&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, 40, &quot;casual&quot;), ClothingItem(&quot;Calvin Klein&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, 90, &quot;formal&quot;), ClothingItem(&quot;H&amp;M&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, 20, &quot;casual&quot;), ClothingItem(&quot;Zara&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, 60, &quot;formal&quot;), ClothingItem(&quot;Tommy Hilfiger&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, 80, &quot;sporty&quot;), ClothingItem(&quot;Ralph Lauren&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, 70, &quot;casual&quot;), ClothingItem(&quot;Puma&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, 50, &quot;sporty&quot;) ] num_users = 100000 simulate_shopping(products, num_users) .

(Hint: what happens if you set both base and power equal to high numbers?) exponent(5, 2) . 5^2 = 25.0 . DAT-1.C: Binary Math . Basic Information . Binary is Base 2, meaning each digit can only represent values of 0 and 1. | Decimal is Base 10, meaning each digit can represent values from 0 to 9. | Conversion between sequences of binary to decimal depend on how many binary numbers there are, their values and their positions. | . Practice Questions: . What values can each digit of a Base 5 system represent? . The value a 5 digit based system can represent is 5^n depending on where it correlates to then the prior values can be added to each other to be able to get the total value of the number as for instance 001001 can be represent as (0 x 2^6) + (0 x 2^6) + (1 x 2^5) ... and how a similar concept can be used in a base 10 system we could do the exact same thing with a base 5 system. | . | What base is Hexadecimal?

Hexadecimal is base 16 and can represent 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F | . | When using a base above 10, letters can be used to represent numbers past 9. These letters start from A and continue onwards. For example, the decimal number 10 is represented by the letter A in Hexadecimal. What letter would be used to represent the Base 10 number 23 in a Base 30 system? What about in a Base 50 system? . | In a base system above 10, letters are used to represent numbers past 9. To find the letter that represents a particular number in a given base system, we perform integer division and modulus operations. For example, to represent the number 23 in a base 30 system, we divide 23 by 30 and take the remainder, which is 23. The corresponding letter for the number 23 in base 30 is H, so 23 in base 30 is represented as the single digit H. Similarly, to represent the number 23 in a base 50 system, we divide 23 by 50 and take the remainder, which is 23. The corresponding letter for the number 23 in base 50 is X, so 23 in base 50 is represented as the single digit X. | . Examples . Using 6 bits, we can represent 64 numbers, from 0 to 63, as 2^6 = 64. | The numbers in a sequence of binary go from right to left, increasing by powers of two from 0 to the total amount of bits. The whole number represented is the sum of these bits.

The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web. . The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. . The “ip” layer is responsible for packeting data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network. . The “network” layer is responsible for routing data packets between networks using the Internet Protocol (IP). This layer handles tasks such as packet addressing and routing, fragmentation and reassembly, and network congestion control. . Fault Tolerance . Watch both Daily videos for 4.2 . Complete the network activity, summarize your understanding of fault tolerance. i. Yes the network is fault tolerant, as if any link or any points is broken the information can still be distributed to other points in the system. | ii. No the network is not fault tolerant, as if node C goes down, then information can’t be sent to F and thus it is not fault tolerant. | iii. No the network is not fault tolerant, as if node G comes down, then information can’t be sent to A and thus the system cannot be described as fault tolerant. Option C | Option A | The importance of fault tolerance is that there is redundancy in your system and one faulty link doesn’t compromise the entire system and information can still be transmitted throughout the entire system. The internet is an example of such a system as if one link is broken, the information can still be sent through other links while the broken link is being repaired. Thus it is vital to create fault tolerant systems with at least one backup link or node per connection in case of a failure. | | . | . Parallel and Distributed Computing . Review previous lecture on Parallel Computing and watch Daily video 4.3. Think of ways to make something in you team project to utilize Cores more effectively. Here are some thoughts to add to your story of Computers and Networks… . What is naturally Distributed in Frontend/Backend architecture? In a frontend/backend architecture, the frontend and backend are naturally distributed components. The frontend typically consists of the user interface and presentation layer, while the backend contains the business logic and data storage. The frontend is distributed across multiple devices or clients, such as web browsers, mobile devices, or desktop applications. Each client has its own instance of the frontend code, which communicates with the backend over a network connection. The backend is typically deployed on one or more servers or cloud platforms. The servers may be physically distributed across multiple locations, and the backend may be composed of multiple services or microservices that work together to provide the required functionality. The distributed nature of the frontend/backend architecture allows for scalability, fault tolerance, and performance optimization. The frontend can be scaled by adding more clients or instances, while the backend can be scaled by adding more servers or services. Fault tolerance can be achieved by replicating the backend across multiple servers or locations, and load balancing can be used to optimize performance by distributing the load across multiple servers. Overall, the frontend/backend architecture is a popular and effective way of building modern web applications that can handle large volumes of users and data. | . | Analyze this command in Docker: ENV GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS=&quot;--workers=1 --bind=0.0.0.0:8086&quot;. Determine if there is options are options in this command for parallel computing within the server that runs python/gunicorn. Here is an article The GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS environment variable is used to set command-line arguments for the Gunicorn web server when it starts up. In the provided command, --workers=1 and --bind=0.0.0.0:8086 are specified as arguments. To run the Gunicorn server in parallel, you can increase the number of worker processes to handle multiple requests simultaneously. To do this, simply set the --workers argument to a higher number. For example, if you want to run four worker processes, you can set the argument to --workers=4. It&#39;s important to note that the number of workers you can run at once will depend on the resources available on your system and the workload your application is handling. Be careful not to increase the number of workers beyond what your system can handle, as this can cause performance issues or even crashes. To make sure everything is running smoothly, it&#39;s a good idea to monitor the resource usage of the worker processes while the server is running with multiple workers. You can use tools like htop, top, or systemd to keep an eye on things. In summary, to run the Gunicorn server in parallel, set the --workers argument to a number that your system can handle, and keep an eye on the resource usage of the worker processes to ensure everything stays stable. | . | .

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # That a set is a collection of unique elements and cannot have duplicate values # # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # They both have to have unique values and cannot have duplicate values. # . {1, 2, 3} .

Provide answers and thoughts on theoretical question form college board Video in section 4.3. They start at about the 9 minute mark. . Example 1 The processing time for the task is determined by the slowest processor. In this case, Process X runs on one processor, while Process Y and Z run on the other. Processor 1 takes 50 seconds, while Processor 2 takes either 10 + 30 seconds or 40 seconds. The overall processing time is 50 seconds because it&#39;s the time taken by Processor 1, which is the slowest of the two processors. | . | Example 2 The slowest process determines the total time taken for the task, whether the two processes run in parallel or one after the other. If they run in parallel, the time taken is 45 seconds, which is the slower of the two processes. However, if they run consecutively, the time taken is 70 seconds, which is the sum of 45 and 25 seconds. The difference between the two methods is 25 seconds, meaning that running the processes in parallel is 25 seconds faster than running them on a single processor. | . | . Data Structures.

            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. .

Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . 263 Alabama . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . 178 1.78 . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) .

Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . Example of Matrix Multiplication . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . [[18, 28], [18, 28]] . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . 263 . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) #print(fibonacci(30)) print(fibonacci(40)) . 102334155 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets numbers1k = list(range(1000)) print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) print (generate_subsets([numbers1k])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) .

Hacks . Record your findings when testing the time elapsed of the different algorithms. | Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. | Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? Time and space complexity is important when choosing an algorithm is if the time an algorithm takes to run it too long for the amount to data that is needed to be processed it would make the algorithm unfit for that task and similarly is the space complexity is too large it would make the algorithm take up too much memory and make it unfit for the task. So based on the needs of the task the time and space complexity should be altered accordingly as if for instance if an algorithm that takes up less time but more memory when there is a surplus of memory and time is key would lead to a better fit for a specific use case. | . | Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? No, as there are many different use cases where constant time algorithms are impossible to solve a specific problem and thus make them not abel to solve a specific problem. The use of an exponential time complexity algorithm may be useful when it is the only solution to a problem or that there are other trade offs involved between a less time intensive solution such as accuracy or memory usage. So when factoring the exact needs of a problem the specific algorithm should be chosen based on the needs of the problem and what trade offs are acceptable. | . | What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? Some general patterns that I noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s space and time complexity is that for instance when there are nested for loops there would mostly like a quadratic time complexity and when there are recursive functions there would most likely be a exponential time complexity. Also when there are multiple nested for loops there would most likely be a exponential time complexity. Using these patterns a programs time complexity can be determined and similarly we can look at how variables are assigned and how they are altered to be able to determine the space complexity of an algorithm. | . | . Complete the Time and Space Complexity analysis questions linked below. Practice . Notes . Big O is a notation for time complexity. Known as Big O notation | O(n) is one for loop where you change everything such as the grayscale algorithm | O(1) no matter how large the algorithm is, it will always take the same amount of time to run | O(n^2) is a nested for nested loops, doing the same thing twice ### Space | Space requires creating space for a new value. | The first binary exponent that is greater than 263 is is 512 which is 2^9 power the maximum amount needed to try that in a binary algorithm is 9. | . Question 1 . from random import random a = 0 b = 0 for i in range(N): a = a + random() for i in range(M): b= b + random() . The answer is option 3 O(N + M) time, O(1) space, as the program with the two different values are independent of each other so the time complexity has to be O(N+M) and the space complexity is 0(1) as the size of the variables doesn&#39;t change based on the size of the input. . Question 2 . a = 0; for i in range(N): for j in reversed(range(i,N)): a = a + i + j; . The answer is option 4 as the time complexity is O(N^2) as due to the nested for loop as the second operation has to be run for every value of N. . Question 3 . k = 0; for i in range(n//2,n): for j in range(2,n,pow(2,j)): k = k + n / 2; . The time complexity is O(nLogn) as the value for J doubles till it is equal to or less than N and it be halved till it is the same value as N making option 2 the correct answer. . Question 4 . What does it mean when we say that an algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y? Options: X will always be a better choice for small inputs X will always be a better choice for large inputs Y will always be a better choice for small inputs X will always be a better choice for all inputs . X will always be a better choice for small inputs as it will perform with less time when dealing with more data. . Question 5 . a = 0 i = N while (i &gt; 0): a += i i //= 2 . The loop in the code runs until i becomes zero. In each iteration of the loop, the value of a is incremented by the value of i, and the value of i is halved using integer division (i //= 2). Since i is divided by 2 in each iteration, the loop will execute log N times before i becomes zero. Thus making the time complexity O(log N) for this algorithm. . Question 6 . Which of the following best describes the useful criterion for comparing the efficiency of algorithms? 1. Time 2. Memory 3. Both of the above 4. None of the above . The Answer is both as space and time complexity need to be considered when choosing an algorithm and thus determining the efficiency of the algorithm. . Question 7 . How is time complexity measured? By counting the number of algorithms in an algorithm. By counting the number of primitive operations performed by the algorithm on a given input size. By counting the size of data input to the algorithm. None of the above . The answer to the problem is option 2 as the way to find time complexity is by determining the operations an algorithm performs and thus find the time complexity. . Question 8 . for i in range(n): i=i*k . The program has a time complexity of O(logk(n)) (option 3) as the loop runs for k^n-1 times due to the range and then raising that value to the value for i. . Question 9 . value = 0; for i in range(n): for j in range(i): value=value+1 . The answer is option 3 as the time complexity is O(n-1) as the for loop inside the outer loop only runs for n-1 times while the outer one runs for n times making the complexity have to bee O(n-1). . Question 10 . Algorithm A and B have a worst-case running time of O(n) and O(logn), respectively. Therefore, algorithm B always runs faster than algorithm A. 1. True 2. False . The answer is False as that algorithm with O(n) time coplexity may perform better than the O(logn) algorithm for values that are less than n^0. .",

The datatypes in an SQL table are: Integer: Integer is a data type that stores whole numbers. | Real: Real is a data type that stores floating point numbers. | Text: Text is a collection of characters stored as a single entity in a database management system. | Blob: Binary Large Object (BLOB) is a collection of binary data stored as a single entity in a database management system. | Null: A null value is a special value that indicates that a value is missing or unknown. | . | . | . import sqlite3 database = &#39;instance/sqlite.db&#39; # this is location of database def schema(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Fetch results of Schema results = cursor.execute(&quot;PRAGMA table_info(&#39;users&#39;)&quot;).fetchall() # Print the results for row in results: print(row) # Close the database connection conn.close() schema() .

Reading Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL SELECT statement to read data . What is a connection object? After you google it, what do you think it does? A connection object is an object that is used to create a unique session that connects to a database. Which contains all the methods needed to alter, view, and change the data within the database and it is used to create a cursor object that is used to execute SQL statements. | . | Same for cursor object? A cursor object is an object that is used to execute SQL statements. It is used to fetch data from a table within a database along with other operations. | . | Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger. What attributes are in the object? The attributes of the conn object are the methods that are used to connect to the database. The attributes of the cursor object are the methods that are used to execute SQL statements. | . | Is &quot;results&quot; an object? How do you know? Yes, results is an object. It contains data and functions that is related to the object. | . | . import sqlite3 def read(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Execute a SELECT statement to retrieve data from a table results = cursor.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM users&#39;).fetchall() # Print the results if len(results) == 0: print(&quot;Table is empty&quot;) else: for row in results: print(row) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() read() .

Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL INSERT to add row . Compare create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations? The implementation in the imperative method is simpler to implement and understand because it is more straightforward. The implementation in the object-oriented method is more complex because it is more abstract however requires less code to implement. Due to more complex operations being abstracted away it requires less knowledge of the underlying implementation. | . | Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init? The purpose of SQL INSERT is to add a new row to a table. It is the same as User init because it is used to create the equivalent of a new user object. | . | . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter your user id:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter your date of birth &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, uid, password, dob)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() create() . Error while executing the INSERT: UNIQUE constraint failed: users._uid . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? The hacked part is if a user&#39;s password is less than 2 letters a it seen as a hack and new password is assigned to the user. | . | Explain try/except, when would except occur? The try/except is used to catch errors that occur in the try block. The except block is executed when an error occurs in the try block. | . | What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? The code conn.cursor() is repeated in each of these examples to point because it is used to create a cursor object that is used to execute SQL statements. Along with cursor.execute() which is used to execute SQL statements and conn.commit() which is used to commit the changes to the database. | . | . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ?

Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? Yes, delete is a dangerous operations because the deleted data cannot be restored | . | In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do?

Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? The menu repeats as it uses recursion to call itself. So that once the function has finished executing it will call itself again. | . | Could you refactor this menu?

Yes, as functions are used to hide the details of the implementation to be able hide complex details from the user making the operations simpler to use. | . | In 2.4a or 2.4b lecture Do you see data abstraction? Complement this with Debugging example. Yes, we see data abstraction through the use of the database to store the data within our database and then to be able to perform operations on the data within the database. | Use Imperative or OOP style to Create a new Table or do something that applies to your CPT project.

An abstraction is veiling something in order to make something simpler such as classes and functions. | . | What is SQL? SQL or Structured Query Language is a language used to communicate with databases. When using sql you are able to create, read, update, and delete data from a database. SQLAlchemy abstracts commands in SQL however as a result of this we cannot see the actual effects of what happens in SQL itself. | . | The most commonly used query in SQL is called select, they will look similar but the command in the middle will be different. | .",

We need routing and need to define attributes and methods for the flask app object | Creating the class defined the attributes we want in the user | Inheriting from the database model allows us to use the database methods | Init method instantiates the object | Having setters and getters allow you to change and receive data from the inside of teh an object, can change the initialized value | Need to have common methods such as create, read, update, delete to have basic functionality and manipulation with the database which help us - interact with the data in the object | Inside a class we can help solve problems a specific problem with your data | Inside an object you can see the data being populated | Sql Alchemy is an object relational model ORM that works with databases in python which we can use to query things from the database | Used to have checks such as those for a matching username and password | Important to run locally as you don&#39;t need all the stuff from others to run your code | . &quot;&quot;&quot; These imports define the key objects &quot;&quot;&quot; from flask import Flask from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy &quot;&quot;&quot; These object and definitions are used throughout the Jupyter Notebook. &quot;&quot;&quot; # Setup of key Flask object (app) app = Flask(__name__) # Setup SQLAlchemy object and properties for the database (db) database = &#39;sqlite:///computers.db&#39; # path and filename of database app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS&#39;] = False app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI&#39;] = database app.config[&#39;SECRET_KEY&#39;] = &#39;SECRET_KEY&#39; db = SQLAlchemy() # This belongs in place where it runs once per project db.init_app(app) &quot;&quot;&quot; database dependencies to support sqlite examples &quot;&quot;&quot; import datetime from datetime import datetime import json from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash &#39;&#39;&#39; Tutorial: https://www.sqlalchemy.org/library.html#tutorials, try to get into a Python shell and follow along &#39;&#39;&#39; # Define the User class to manage actions in the &#39;users&#39; table # -- Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is the key concept of SQLAlchemy # -- a.) db.Model is like an inner layer of the onion in ORM # -- b.)

From Pandas Overview -- When working with tabular data, such as data stored in spreadsheets or databases, pandas is the right tool for you. pandas will help you to explore, clean, and process your data. In pandas, a data table is called a DataFrame. | . . &#39;&#39;&#39;Pandas is used to gather data sets through its DataFrames implementation&#39;&#39;&#39; import pandas as pd . Cleaning Data . When looking at a data set, check to see what data needs to be cleaned. Examples include: . Missing Data Points | Invalid Data | Inaccurate Data | . Run the following code to see what needs to be cleaned . df = pd.read_json(&#39;files/grade.json&#39;) print(df) # What part of the data set needs to be cleaned? # From PBL learning, what is a good time to clean data?

It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

Cat is the command that allows you to see the contents of a file. | What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? Some commands like dir, cd, find, and type are used to access files in the windows terminal. Dir is the command that allows you to see the files in the directory that you are currently in. Cd is the command that allows you to change directories. Find is the command that allows you to search for a specific word in a file. Type is the command that allows you to see the contents of a file. | What are some of the major differences? The major differences are the names of the commands but their functionality is the same. | . Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code. . Why is path a big deal when working with images? Path is a big deal when working with images because it is the way that the computer knows where to find the image. If the path is wrong, the computer will not be able to find the image and will not be able to display it. Also the different operating systems have different ways of writing the path, so if you are working on a mac and you try to run the code on a windows computer, it will not work because the path is written differently. | How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? The meta data is the data that associated with the image which can be used to identify the image. The source is the location of the image and the label is the name of the image. This relates to unit 5 as this data may be used for greater functionality such as knowing things like the location where it was taken, who took it, etc. | Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images? As it allows you to display images as the output of a cell. This is interesting as it allows you to view the changes being made to the image in real time. | . from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) # Run this as standalone tester to see sample data printed in Jupyter terminal if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # print parameter supplied image green_square = image_data(images=[{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}]) image_display(green_square) # display default images from image_data() default_images = image_data() image_display(default_images) . Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow) . PIL (Python Image Library) . Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? Binary is a numbering system that uses only two digits, 0 and 1, to represent numbers. In computers, binary is used to represent data and instructions using electrical signals, where a &quot;0&quot; is represented by no electrical signal and a &quot;1&quot; is represented by an electrical signal. Hexadecimal is also a numbering system that uses 16 digits, 0 to 9 and A to F, to represent numbers. It is often used in computing as a shorthand for binary, as one hexadecimal digit can represent four binary digits. They are similar in the fact that they are both numbering systems. They are different in the fact that they use different digits to represent numbers. . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. The first three letters of my name &quot;tir&quot; in hexadecimal is 746972 | . numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? I have been a consumer of buffering on large streaming platforms such as the likes of Youtube, Spotify, Amazon Prime, etc. This is because these platforms have a lot of data that needs to be sent to the user and it takes time for the data to be sent. | From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? The video will play in chunks with a pause in between each chunk as the platform is getting additional data. But this also allows for poor connection at times to not effect playback of the content. | How do these effects apply to images? The effects of buffering apply to images in the same way that they apply to videos. The image will be displayed in chunks with portions of the image loading in before others until the entire images can be displayed. | . text = &quot;tir&quot; hex_text = text.encode(&quot;utf-8&quot;).hex() print(hex_text) . 746972 . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program. . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? Yes the program appears as if there are some original steps such as resizing the image and then applying a series of steps then being able to shift the image from color to grey scale. | Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? This grayscale algorithm takes a color image represented as a numpy array where each pixel contains an RGB tuple (3 values per pixel) or an RGBA tuple (4 values per pixel), and converts it into a grayscale image. For each pixel, the algorithm takes the average of the three RGB values (or four values for RGBA) and sets each value in the tuple to that average value. This process results in a gray pixel value for each pixel, where the same gray pixel value is assigned to each of the RGB channels in the resulting grayscale image.Finally, the resulting grayscale image is converted to a PIL image and encoded as a base64 string, which can be displayed in a Jupyter Notebook or a web page. | Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? The pixels between the original and the scaled image are the same with both images having a height scale of 1 and length of 340px. The scale image function keeps the height the same and then sets the length to 340px. | Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? No as no data is being compressed as there is no type of compression algorithm is being used. Such as changing between lossy and lossless image formats. The image is just being resized. | . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(img): baseWidth = 320 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() # Set Properties of Image, Scale, and convert to Base64 def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(image[&#39;pil&#39;], image[&#39;format&#39;]) # Create Grey Scale Base64 representation of Image def image_management_add_html_grey(image): # Image open return PIL image object img = image[&#39;pil&#39;] format = image[&#39;format&#39;] img_data = img.getdata() # Reference https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pil-image-getdata/ image[&#39;data&#39;] = np.array(img_data) # PIL image to numpy array image[&#39;gray_data&#39;] = [] # key/value for data converted to gray scale # &#39;data&#39; is a list of RGB data, the list is traversed and hex and binary lists are calculated and formatted for pixel in image[&#39;data&#39;]: # create gray scale of image, ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-a-numpy-array-to-an-image/ average = (pixel[0] + pixel[1] + pixel[2]) // 3 # average pixel values and use // for integer division if len(pixel) &gt; 3: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average, pixel[3])) # PNG format else: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average)) # end for loop for pixels img.putdata(image[&#39;gray_data&#39;]) image[&#39;html_grey&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(img, format) # Jupyter Notebook Visualization of Images if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # Use numpy to concatenate two arrays images = image_data() # Display meta data, scaled view, and grey scale for each image for image in images: image_management(image) print(&quot;- meta data --&quot;) print(image[&#39;label&#39;]) print(image[&#39;source&#39;]) print(image[&#39;format&#39;]) print(image[&#39;mode&#39;]) print(&quot;Original size: &quot;, image[&#39;size&#39;]) print(&quot;Scaled size: &quot;, image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;]) print(&quot;-- original image --&quot;) display(HTML(image[&#39;html&#39;])) print(&quot; grey image -&quot;) image_management_add_html_grey(image) display(HTML(image[&#39;html_grey&#39;])) print() . - meta data -- Green Square Internet PNG RGBA Original size: (16, 16) Scaled size: (320, 320) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- Clouds Impression Peter Carolin PNG RGBA Original size: (320, 234) Scaled size: (320, 234) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- Lassen Volcano Peter Carolin JPEG RGB Original size: (2792, 2094) Scaled size: (320, 240) -- original image -- . grey image - . .

The purpose of this program is to be able to create a system where user scores are ranked and displayed in a sorted manner based on the user&#39;s score. | . 3aii . The video demonstrates the adding of a score to the scoreboard and then ordering the score to its corresponding location after creating the leader, only if the score is greater than 0. | . 3aiii . The inputs and outputs of this program are the following: Inputs: The user&#39;s name | The user&#39;s score | . | Outputs: Success message indicating creation or telling the user score is 0 | The user&#39;s score&#39;s location being sorted on the scoreboard | . | These metrics prevent the leaderboard from being cluttered with scores that are 0 and creates the corresponding score table for the games that have been played. | . | . 3b . 3bi . leader1 = Leader(username=&#39;sreeja&#39;, score=5) leader2 = Leader(username=&#39;ekam&#39;, score=4) leader3 = Leader(username=&#39;tirth&#39;, score=3) leader4 = Leader(username=&#39;mani&#39;, score=2) leader5 = Leader(username=&#39;user&#39;, score=1) leaders = [leader1, leader2, leader3, leader4, leader5] . 3bii . &quot;&quot;&quot;Builds sample user/note(s) data&quot;&quot;&quot; for leader in leaders: try: leader.create() except IntegrityError: &#39;&#39;&#39;fails with bad or duplicate data&#39;&#39;&#39; db.session.remove() print(f&quot;Records exist, duplicate email, or error: {leader.username}&quot;) . 3biii . The name of the list is called leaders which stores 5 Leader objects. The code snippet above shows the use of a for loop to iterate through the list and follow through the create method in the Leader class which adds the Leader to the Leaderboard SQL table. Which contributes the greater functionality of the program this allows for the creation of a database with data which is then used later in the program through the use of SQL alchemy functions to be able to sort the data in the database and thus generate the filtered leaderboard and be accessed via a get request. Along with the user of other functions such as endpoints to be able to access all the scores of a selected Leader via post request specifying the desired Leader. | . 3biv . The data in the list leaders represent the scores that will be added to the leaderboard and then be sorted by their highest scores. | . 3bv . If the list was not used it would make it so that there would for one not be data to sort and search for user scores as there would be no content in the database thus making it so that the inherent functionality of the program would not be able to be used. Along with the fact that if the list was not used the creation of Leader entries. | . 3c . 3ci . class _Score(Resource): def post(self): &#39;&#39;&#39; Read data for json body &#39;&#39;&#39; body = request.get_json() username = body.get(&#39;username&#39;) score = body.get(&#39;score&#39;) user = User.query.filter((User._username == username)).first # this is checking for garbage data and stopping it if username == &#39;null&#39;: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;error no login&#39;}, 210 if user is False: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;error no user&#39;}, 210 if int(score) is False or int(score) &lt;= 0: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;error no score&#39;}, 210 &#39;&#39;&#39; #1: Key code block, setup USER OBJECT &#39;&#39;&#39; leader = Leader(username=username, score=score) # create user in database user = leader.create() # success returns json of user if user: return jsonify(user.read()) # failure returns error return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Processed {username}, either a format error or score {score} is negative or zero&#39;}, 210 . 3cii . // Get user ID from local storage const userId = localStorage.getItem(&quot;userid&quot;); // Define the endpoint URL const url = &quot;http://localhost:8086/api/leadersfiltered/score&quot;; // Define the request parameters as an object const data = { username: userId, score: matchCounter }; // Define the request options const options = { method: &quot;POST&quot;, headers: { &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot; }, body: JSON.stringify(data) }; // Send the request with fetch() fetch(url, options) .then(response =&gt; { if (!response.ok) { throw new Error(&quot;Network response was not ok&quot;); } return response.json(); }) .then(data =&gt; { console.log(data); }) .catch(error =&gt; { console.error(&quot;There was a problem with the fetch operation:&quot;, error); }); . 3ciii . The procedure is for creating the Leader object through a post request in which the data that is received is the value from the post request that is for the username and score values. Where goes through selection statements that validate is teh user is a valid user and that if the users score is greater than 0. After which it creates a Leader object and then runs the create method which adds the Leader to the Leaderboard SQL table. Here the values are for the values of UserId and that of the matchCounter representing the user&#39;s score these are then used in the call of the function via its api endpoint. | . 3civ . The procedure begins by taking the values from the body of the post request such as the username and score that is sent then the function checks if the user is a valid user and if the score meets the minimum threshold via the selection statements. After which the function creates a Leader object and then runs the create method which adds the Leader to the Leaderboard SQL table. . 3d . 3di . Call #1: . Call #2: . 3dii . What is being tested by the first call is the ability to validate if a user has a score and if not it is not possible for them to be able to send a score through the post endpoint as the users score is not allowed pass due to the selection statement giving an error 210 in the function. What is being tested in the second call is the ability to send a score if the user has a valid score and then showing the score being added to the table and then it is sorted and ranked by the highest score (this portion is a result of a another but related procedure). . 3diii .

            "content": "Personal Identifiable Information (PII) . PII is any information that can be used to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. | PII can be made up of a variety of different kinds of data, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, social security numbers, and other identifiers. | PII can also include information about a person’s physical or mental health, financial information, or other information that can be used to identify a person. | The kind of PII that we&#39;ve seen in our personal projects is the storing of use data in a login system such as the user&#39;s information, uid, username, password, etc. This kind of information can tie an account to a person&#39;s identity. | We have also seen personal information when signing up for services that we use such as accounts for microsoft, google, github, etc. which store emails, phone numbers, often address and other information while setting up the tools that we use to create our projects. | . Feeling PII &amp; Personal Exposure . My feelings about PII is that they are needed for the creation for accounts and are the only way to create a way in a single person can be tied to a single account. My personal exposure to these concepts is through the creation of accounts for services that I use such as github, google, microsoft, youtube, etc. This will mean that if there is a data breach, my information will be exposed to the public and can be used to steal content such as my identity, my credit card information, my bank account information, etc. | . Good Vs. Bad Password . A good password is one that are random, complex, and long as it makes them harder to decrypt and social engineer and makes them harder to guess or trick out of you. Bad passwords are ones that are easy to guess, easy to social engineer, or easy to trick out of you such as your name, your birthday, your address, your phone number, pet&#39;s name, etc. | . Symmetric &amp; Asymmetric Encryption . Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. This is the most common type of encryption that we see in our daily lives such as the encryption of our passwords. This means that there is a faster encryption and decryption process as the same key is used for both. Example Symmetric Encryption: AES, DES, 3DES, etc. . | Asymmetric encryption is a type of encryption where there are two keys, a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt the data and the private key is used to decrypt the data. This is the type of encryption that we see in our daily lives when we use https websites such as google, github, etc. Example Asymmetric Encryption: RSA, ECC, etc. . | . AWS Deployment . We used private and public ssh keys while deploying our project to AWS we also created a .pem file that we used to ssh into our instance. We used some basic encryption in our AWS project. However, other than that I don&#39;t think we used any other encryption in our project as we were not knowledgeable enough to do so. | . How I got Phished . I was once sent an email by a group claiming to be Wells Fargo Customer Service. The email was sent to my personal email and was asking me to verify my account information. I was asked to click on a link and enter my information. However, considering the fact that I don&#39;t have a Wells Fargo account, I knew that this was a phishing email. However, had I been tricked I may have entered in sensitive information such as my social security number, my bank account information, etc. | .",

There are different kinds of licenses that are used for different purposes. Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal (CC0) This license is used for software that is in the public domain. This means that the software is free to use and modify without any restrictions. | . | Open Source MIT License This license allows users to use code for any purpose, including commercial use. It also allows users to modify the code and distribute the modified code. Which would involve making the code closed source. User also needs to credit the original author of the code. | . | GNU General Public License v3.0 Allows users to use the code source for any purpose that they wish to similar to the Open Source MIT License. However, this code must be open source and cannot be closed source. | . | . | . Discussion &amp; Personal Discussion . Pros: Software can be accredited to the original author if their license requires it. | Software can be transformed and used in different ways if allowed | Software theft can be identified and prevented so the user can protect their work | Creators can profit from their work and use it for commercial gain | . | Cons: System can be abused to protect work that is not original | Freedom and use of content can be limited such as certain licenses not allowing commercial use | False flags of software theft can be used to prevent the use of software that is competing against their solution | . | . Conclusion &amp; Personal Conclusion . The License I used for my personal repository is the GNU License. I chose this license because I wanted to allow users to use my code for any purpose that they wish to. I also wanted to allow users to modify the code however I want to prevent them from being able to close source the code so it will always be available.

I made a series of mistakes mostly which were made due to lack of concentration and focus and not reading the questions carefully. This was a result of the last minute and late nature of its completion and the length of the test becoming a hinderance to my success. A solution would be to better manage my time and to take breaks at appropriate times. | . Question 12 . Solved the problem incorrectly as my answer of A “(onFloor1 AND callTo2) AND (onFloor2 AND callTo1)” would have been impossible as both conditions cannot be true at once as the elevator is not in a state of superposition between the two floors. Thus making my answer incorrect and the correct answer being B “(onFloor1 AND callTo2) OR (onFloor2 AND callTo1)”. This mistake was caused by not reading the solutions properly and this failing to notice this issue. | . Question 15 . I again misread the problem and attempted to find a pattern in which the robot would move to the indicated square however the question was asking for the option which would not move the robot onto the indicated square. Thus making my answer of C incorrect and the answer clearly being D. | . Question 17 . I didn’t fully read the instructions on the problem and did not select all the correct solutions as asked in the problem and thus only selected A one of the two correct answers making my solution incorrect. The correct answers were A and D. | . Question 22 . I misunderstood that both algorithms were functional as in algorithm 1 which indicated that the weight of a student would be replaced I thought that this was before they were added thus my answer that only B was correct was incorrect. Again caused by lack of focus and attentiveness. | . Question 49 . I selected the answer of of C “Every problem can be solved with an algorithm for all possible inputs, but some of these algorithms have not been discovered yet.” which was incorrect as there are problems which cannot be modeled given all the possible inputs to a situation and thus due to this scenario existing which I had not though possible. Thus the answer D is correct answer as “There exist problems that no algorithm will ever be able to solve for all possible inputs.” This was caused by a fault in my login by not understanding the limits of algorithms. | .",

            "title": "Digital Divide & Equity",
            "content": "Investments in Digital Education Vs. Security . When considering the question how may investments into security affect technological education and wether they increase the digital divide. It would be crucially important to focus on the efforts made by institution public or private towards technological education and equity and the movements made to restrict such access based upon security concerns. Some program which wish to lessen the digital divide are programs such as the Affordable Connectivity Program from the FCC which wished to allow for the greater proliferation of broadband technologies to allow for lower income households to be able to be receive internet services at a reduced cost along with hardware such as personal computers, tablets, etc. Similar services from private institutions include projects such as Microsoft Airband which strives to provide internet access to areas where such access would otherwise be unavailable through satellite communications with a collaboration from Viasat and attempts to provide the best connectivity for that region. However how these programs designed to reduce the digital divide and increase equity through creating the opportunity for communities who are unable access such resources and these services allow for greater connectivity and allow for greater digital expression and create allow for greater upwards mobility in professions such as computer science a field where having access to a machine is otherwise impossible and support families to be able to partake in digital activities which we consider to be required for day to day task such as schoolwork or social interaction. These goals may be limited by fears of privacy and security as institutions government or otherwise may wish to prevent the spread of information or content that may be against their political goals in nations such as China where content that descents the CCP is unavailable in the country along with many services we are accustomed to. Further restrictions may come from group such as religious or educational bodies that may wish to restrict access to content that is believed to be against their rules/beliefs such as restrictions on communal machines at school restricting internet access or religious institutions blocking content related to sexual education and content that may lead their followers to challenge their faith in places like religious universities. These restrictions continue to increase the divide by preventing access to crucial information and resources that may be needed to be able to partake in the digital world. . | References: . https://www.fcc.gov/acp | https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/airband-initiative | . | . Digital Empowerment . Some methods to increasing digital empowerment may be to one primarily increase the knowledge and digital literacy in groups such as the elderly to make them more in tune and more able to partake in the digital world through being less likely to fall victim to fraud and misleading results on questionable webpages and thus be more likely fall prey to misinformation. Other methods of digital empowerment could be the ability to be combat issues such as racial bias and prejudice through creating digital communities to counter such issues in a way otherwise impossible. Along with other methods available for individuals to empower themselves to for instance leak government wrongdoings in an anonymous manner along with creating tools for those in countries with goals of limiting the proliferation of knowledge with tools such as VPNs o be able to bypass these censors and be able to gain new knowledge and information. | . Helping the Unempowered . For instance helping a student who is digitally unempowered at Del Norte High School would most likely be to either if they were unfamiliar with the technology support them in able to learn and be able to express themselves through the technology and be able to better be able to accomplish tasks such as school work or create things that they may have wished to but otherwise would have been unable. If they didn&#39;t have access to the needed resources such as a functioning computer or internet access we can either use the help of existing programs and resources to be able to overcome these forms on inequity or we can create our own programs and fundraisers in order to rectify the issue. For a more general case the best way to allow to empower those digitally unempowered would be to create create programs and seminars or classes to increase technical literacy and digital literacy to greater empower those who need it by being less likely to fall prey to fraud and misinformation and be able to better partake in the digital world. Or to create and support programs that allow for greater access to the internet and technology to those who are unable to access it such as local charities and programs that support such causes or create our own if none exist. | . Red Tape? . Red tape or excessive bureaucracy would increase the digital divide as such restrictions would prevent needed access to resources in public institutions like schools and preventing the installation or use of needed programs and software preventing increasing the technical knowledge and success of students. Or the inability to create new systems in places like government such as new initiatives to provide the tools individuals need for success. Along with failing to properly adapt to the changing technological landscape through failing to allow access to new revolutionary technologies or preventing exploitation of individuals at risk such as the elderly or children.Such instances at Del Norte could be the inability to transfer files to and off school systems from external drives along with being unable to access programs on school machines thus making them unable to support students to the degree they otherwise would be able to, another limitation is the inability to install programs and remove them from school machines to accomplish goals for classes like computer science courses. To further add to the point of greater inabilities on school property would be internet restrictions on school wifi preventing access to important information or the ability access tools and files needed for school work as seen in the need for us to use a VPN to access all the material needed for this class. In other places similar restrictions would be the inability access resources due to aging systems that no longer are in tune with local technological landscape and are functionally obsolete and unable to be updated to be able to support the needs of the community. Other instances may include efforts by government bodies that serve to be functional due to taking too long to able to pass through cumbersome bureaucratic processes and thus are unable to be implemented in a timely manner and thus are unable to be able to serve the needs of the community as by the time they are implemented they are functionally obsolete or watered down due to opposing interests and in both scenarios are functionally useless to the community or otherwise. | .",

Automated systems and technologies have shaped the way we live and operate as individuals in society from the way we research and the way we communicate and interact with each other. . As a result of revolutionary services and products that have shaped the way we live such as search providers like Yahoo, Google, and Bing with have revolutionized the form in which we do research from having the information available to us from only those available in our local libraries and museums to having access to information from the entire human collective. . | Through the development of technologies such as that of social media such as the rise of early platforms such as MySpace and internet chat rooms that allowed for expression of individuals digitally from across the world to bond over communal interests and issues. These innovations led to the rise of more modern services that fulfill those interests today such as the likes of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. These platforms allowed repressed groups to share their experiences in a manner where they would otherwise have been unable championing the rise of movements such as the MeToo movement for sexual harassment or bring awareness to racial and police violence. . | Through the creation of services such as Tor which provide for users to have greater anonymity through the creation of a network of relays that allow for users to access the internet without having their IP address revealed. This has allowed for users to have greater freedom of speech and expression without fear of retribution from governments or other entities. Which allows for government whistleblowers to showcase corruption and other illegal activities at play without fear of retribution, and communications to media outlets from those being targeted by criminal groups or those with inside information on the matter allowing for those individuals to be protected from harm. . | . | . Harmful Effects . There may have been major changes to the way we live and operate within our day to day lives or the way the world as we know it can exist. These technologies created their own harmful effects from alternative methods of using these technologies. . Harmful effects of technologies such as that of Google Search, Bing, and other web tools has been the spread of misinformation through the inability to filter the mass volume of content being produced serving to misinform and mislead those who follow such outlets. Further issues present include the proliferation of malware ridden advertisements serving to mislead and harm vulnerable individuals through the focus on maximizing profits without properly filtering disingenuous actors. . | Harmful effects of social media platforms such as that of Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have been the spread of misinformation and the spread of hate speech. These platforms have been used to spread misinformation and disinformation to the masses through the use of bots and other automated systems to spread propaganda and misinformation along with spreading hate speech and other forms of discrimination against marginalized groups. These issues have also been compounded with the algorithmic and profit driven structures present in these platforms serving to create echo chambers and filter out opposing views and opinions and creating systems that create unhealthy practices and trends. To further add to misuse of these platforms also serve as an anonymous way to spread illegal content circumventing the moderation on these services as seen in the scandal just a few years prior of child porn circulating on Twitter in such communities. . | Through the creation of such anonymizing systems such as the Tor Network and other such services even though the permit the greater expression of those who would otherwise be unable such services promote those with nefarious and illegitimate motives to allow the proliferation of illegal goods and services. Seen in the creation of services like the Silk Road which resulted in illegal trade of drugs and firearms. Such services can also be for spreading other illegal and unjust services such as child porn and other forms of illegal content. . | . | . Dopamine Issues and Technology . Through the creation of services and social media platforms such as the likes of TikTok and Snapchat which are extremely youth focused has resulted in the rise of those who are addicted to such service. As in goals to increase usage attempt to be as addictive as possible to be able sell advertisements and other services along with the nature of these services promoting individuals to be hyperactive online often to their detriment. | . Are domaine issues real? . First to cover what is Dopamine is neurotransmitter and is involved in the pleasure response of our body and serves to reward activity such as food, clothing, sexual interaction, etc. . | Dopamine issues via social media allows for over-consumption as it adapts a system created for survival against predators and the creation of human bonds and connections. Through social media platforms flooding the brain with dopamine and upon continuos suggesting of content tailored by algorithms specifically for the user, after this dopamine overdose three leads to a deficit in dopamine in the system as it the bodies dopamine levels are unnaturally elevated. Similar to how the body is flooded with extreme quantities of dopamine if one were to face something along the likes of a drug addiction. . | . Dopamine Issues at Del Norte High School . Similar issues are prevalent at Del Norte High School with it being commonplace for students to record and post their lives online on various social media platforms or use engage on several of those platforms. Causing symptoms such as dopamine over-stimulation and addiction to these platforms which may affect them in a myriad of situation such as school work or otherwise. | . My Experience . I personally have never been through such issues in a way where they impacted my life or my success in High School, however, I sympathize with those who have underwent such addictions and struggled to be able to work due to social media pressures or been unable to focus on or perform in school work or tasks. | .",

This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Category: Storing &amp; Manipulating Data | Definition: A variable is a named location used to store data in the memory. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Its sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This allows for better organization of the data, and allows the data to be accessed and modified by a reference to an identifier. Variables can also be changed during a program&#39;s execution. Variables can be used for storing data of different types, such as numbers, strings, lists, etc. Variables are created when you assign a value to it. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables. The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable. | . Variable Code Example . def rectangle_area(): width = int(input(&quot;Enter the width of the rectangle: &quot;)) height = int(input(&quot;Enter the height of the rectangle: &quot;)) unit = input(&quot;Enter the unit of measurement: &quot;) area = width * height print(f&quot;The area of the rectangle is: {area} square {unit}&quot;) rectangle_area() # Through assigning variables the program is able to store the # imputed values and use them in the calculation of the area. # The program is also able to print the result of the calculation. # Without variables the program would not be able to store the values # and would not be able to print the result of the calculation. . The area of the rectangle is: 288 square in . Data Types . Category: Storing &amp; Manipulating Data | Definition: Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. Python has various data types that are used to define the operations possible on them and the storage method for each of them. The data type specifies the size and type of values that can be stored in the variable. The data type of a variable is the type of data that variable can store. For example, a variable of type int can only store integer values. The data type of a variable can be changed during the execution of a program. Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories: Text Type: str | Numeric Types: int, float, complex | Sequence Types: list, tuple, range | Mapping Type: dict | Set Types: set, frozenset | Boolean Type: bool | Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, and memoryview. | . | However more the most common data types are Integers, Floats, Strings, Booleans, and Lists/Arrays. In some programming languages like C, C++, and Java, the data types are explicitly declared. In Python, the data type is automatically inferred from the value assigned to the variable. | . Data Types Code Example . Data = [1, 3.14, &quot;Hello&quot;, True, [1, 2, 3], (1, 2, 3), {1, 2, 3}, {&quot;a&quot;: 1, &quot;b&quot;: 2, &quot;c&quot;: 3}] for datatype in Data: print(f&quot; n{datatype} is of {type(datatype)}&quot;) # This program showcases the different data types in Python. The program doesn&#39;t # contain all the data types in python but illustrates a few of the main ones. # BTW at index 6 in the list is the object is a set, not a dictionary. . 1 is of &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; 3.14 is of &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt; Hello is of &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; True is of &lt;class &#39;bool&#39;&gt; [1, 2, 3] is of &lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt; (1, 2, 3) is of &lt;class &#39;tuple&#39;&gt; {1, 2, 3} is of &lt;class &#39;set&#39;&gt; {&#39;a&#39;: 1, &#39;b&#39;: 2, &#39;c&#39;: 3} is of &lt;class &#39;dict&#39;&gt; . Assignment Operators . Category: Storing &amp; Manipulating Data | Definition: An assignment statement creates new variables and gives them values. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables. The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable. The assignment operator (=) is used to assign values to variables. The value of the right-hand side of the expression is calculated first and then assigned to the variable on the left-hand side. The assignment operator can also be used to assign the result of any expression to a variable. Other assignment operators in python also include +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=, &amp;=, |=, ^=, &gt;&gt;=, &lt;&lt;=, etc. Which are used for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, floor division, exponent, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, bitwise XOR, bitwise right shift, bitwise left shift, respectively. | . Assignment Operators Code Example . import random def bubmler(): # Variable Declaration runs = 0 temp_itmes = 0 bundle = [] # Comedic Prints used to make the program more fun print(&quot;Oh no the Bubmbler has gotten hold of you your shopping is going to be bumbled!&quot;) # User input for the number of items the bumbler has gotten hold of to iterate through items = int(input(&quot;How many objects did the bumbler get hold of?&quot;)) # Prints the number of items the bumbler has gotten hold of print(f&quot;The Bumbler has gotten hold of {items} items beware they will be bumbled!&quot;) # The use of the = assignment operator is used to assign the value of items to temp_items temp_itmes = items # Uses the -= operator to decrement the value of temp_items by 1 # The while loop is used to iterate through the number of items the bumbler has gotten hold of # The input function is used to get the name of the object the bumbler has gotten hold of while temp_itmes &gt; 0: ToBeBumbled = input(&quot;What object did the bumbler get hold of?&quot;) bundle.append(ToBeBumbled) temp_itmes -= 1 # Tells the user what items the bumbler has gotten hold of print(&quot;The Bumbler has gotten hold of these items: &quot;) print(*bundle, sep=&quot;, &quot;) # Uses random.shuffle to shuffle the items the bumbler has gotten hold of # Uses random.randint to generate a random number between 0 and the number # of items the bumbler has gotten hold of and if the number is 3 then the # bumbler will take the item if the bumbler has taken an item then it # will be replaced with &quot;The bumblers price&quot; and tell the user they have been bumbled random.shuffle(bundle) for bumble in bundle: if random.randint(0, len(bundle)) == 3: location = bundle.index(bumble) bundle[location] = &quot;The bumblers price&quot; print(&quot;Your bubmbled items are: &quot;) print(*bundle, sep=&quot;, &quot;) if &quot;The bumblers price&quot; in bundle: print(&quot;You have been bumbled!&quot;) bubmler() . Oh no the Bubmbler has gotten hold of you your shopping is going to be bumbled! The Bumbler has gotten hold of 6 items beware they will be bumbled! The Bumbler has gotten hold of these items: 2 gallons of milk, bottled water, cheese sticks, wallet, car, watch Your bubmbled items are: The bumblers price, The bumblers price, 2 gallons of milk, watch, wallet, The bumblers price You have been bumbled! . Lists . Category: Managing Complexity with Variables | Definition: A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. In Python lists are written with square brackets. Lists are one of the most versatile data types available in Python which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Important thing about a list is that items do not have to be the same type. ex. list1 = [&#39;physics&#39;, &#39;chemistry&#39;, 1997, 2000]; list2 = [1, 2.00, &quot;butter&quot;, {1, 2, 3}, False ]; list3 = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;] | . Lists Code Example . def flowers(): # Variable Declaration flower = &quot;&quot; flower_list = [] # The while loop is used to iterate through the number of flowers the user has while flower != &quot;done&quot;: flower = input(&quot;Enter a flower (type done to finish): &quot;) if flower != &quot;done&quot;: flower_list.append(flower) # The for loop is used to iterate through the list of flowers and print them for flower in flower_list: print(f&quot; {flower} are blooming this year.&quot;) flowers() # Creates a list called flower_list then then the user is asked to enter a flower # until they type done. Then a for loop is used to iterate through the list of flowers # and print then print that they are blooming this year. This code could be adapted by # adding a more useful operation that could be done to the list. # To see an example that incorporates this see the bumbler program above. . violets are blooming this year. roses are blooming this year. poppies are blooming this year. . 2D Lists . Category: Managing Complexity with Variables | Definition: 2D Lists also referred to as matrixes are lists of lists. They are used to store data in a tabular form. For example, a list of lists can be used to store rows and columns of data. Complexity can be manged through the use of 2D lists by storing and being able to manipulate data in a more manageable way for instance it can be stored in a tabular form so for instance you could make it so that a coulum represents a field and a row represents a record. Using these types of lists data can also be categorized in a better manner as it allows you to store related data together. Or for algorithms that require you to stored in a grid like structure such as a maze or a game board, or image processing. | . 2D Lists Code Example . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] def printer(keyboard): rsp = input(&quot;Month: &quot;) rsp2 = input(&quot;Age: &quot;) solve_rsp = &quot;&quot; + str(rsp.upper().strip()) solve_rsp2 = &quot;&quot; + str(rsp2).strip().upper() print(&quot;Month Born:&quot;, end = &quot; &quot;) for letter in solve_rsp: if any(letter in row for row in keyboard): print(letter, end=&quot;&quot;) else: print(&quot;You have entered an invalid character&quot;) print(&quot; nAge:&quot;, end=&quot; &quot;) for letter in solve_rsp2: if any(letter in row for row in keyboard): print(letter, end=&quot;&quot;) else: print(&quot;You have entered an invalid character&quot;) printer(keyboard) # Here is an example of a program that uses a 2d list to store the charectors of the keyboard # The program then asks the user to enter a month and age and then prints the charectors of the # month and age if they are in the keyboard list so for instance if the charectors are not in # the keyboard list it will print not a valid charector. .

Dictionaries . Category: Managing Complexity with Variables | Defintion: A dictionary stores (key, value) pairs, similar to a Map in Java or an object in Javascript. Dictionaries are optimized to retrieve values when the key is known. In Python, a dictionary is created by placing a sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by ‘comma’. Dictionary holds a pair of values, one being the Key and the other corresponding pair element being its Key:value. Values in a dictionary can be of any datatype and can be duplicated, whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be immutable. Dictionaries are optimized to retrieve values when the key is known. Python’s dictionaries are kind of hash table type. It consists of key-value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost any Python type, but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python object. This can be used to mangage complexity as through storing key and value pairs it can prevent the need for things like having a secondary list to store the values of a key. This can also be used to store data in a more organized manner as it can be used to store data in a way that is more easily accessible. For instance if you were to store a list of students and their grades you could use a dictionary to store the students name as the key and the grade as the value. This would allow you to easily access the grade of a student by simply using the students name as the key. | . Dictionaries Code Example . Q_Bank = { &quot;Dynamic code is code that has inputs and outputs that can change?&quot;:&quot;true&quot;, &quot;What is the keyword for defining a function in Python?&quot;: &quot;def&quot;, &quot;In Jupyter Notebooks the Input is in line with the Output&quot;: &quot;false&quot;, &quot;What is grouping often used commands called?&quot;: &quot;procedural abstraction&quot;, &quot;Is Mr.Mortenson them most handsome man on the planet?&quot;: &quot;true&quot;, } score = 0 for Q, ans in Q_Bank.items(): print(Q) rsp = input(Q) if rsp.lower().strip() == ans.lower().strip(): print(f&quot;Your answer {rsp} is the correct answer&quot;) score += 1 else: print(f&quot;Your answer {rsp} doesn&#39;t equal the correct answer/s which is {ans}&quot;) print(f&quot;Your score is {score} out of {len(Q_Bank)} points.&quot;) # Uses a dictionary to store the questions and answers and a value pair associated with each question # to store the answer to the question. Then a for loop is used to iterate through the dictionary and # then print the question and ask the user to enter the answer. If the answer matches the value in the dictionary # it informs the user that they were correct and then adds one to the score. If the answer is incorrect it informs # the user that they were incorrect and then prints the correct answer. Once the for loop has finished it prints # the users score out of the total number of questions. . Dynamic code is code that has inputs and outputs that can change? Your answer true is the correct answer What is the keyword for defining a function in Python? Your answer def is the correct answer In Jupyter Notebooks the Input is in line with the Output Your answer false is the correct answer What is grouping often used commands called? Your answer bundles doesn&#39;t equal the correct answer/s which is procedural abstraction Is Mr.Mortenson them most handsome man on the planet? Your answer true is the correct answer Your score is 4 out of 5 points. . Class Expressions . Category: Managing Complexity with Variables | Definition: Class expressions are not present within python, however, when they are present in Javascript where instead of a statement an expression is used. This allows a class to be used and then defined later, anonymous classses where they can be unnamed for a class that just needs to be used once, or allow it to be used in the same places that variables could be used in. | . Class Expressions Code Example . class Person { constructor(name, age) { this.name = name; this.age = age; } greeting() { return `Hello my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old`; } } // Use of Class Expressions class Wagie extends Person { constructor(name, age, job) { super(name, age); this.job = job; } greeting() { return `Hello I work at ${this.job} and my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old. My profression conusmes my life and I have no time for friends or family. I am a slave to foul beast known as capitalism.`; } } // Use of class expressions class Student extends Person { constructor(name, age, grade) { super(name, age); this.grade = grade; } greeting() { return `Hey my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old and I am in grade ${this.grade}!!`; } } const Jhon = new Wagie(&quot;John&quot;, 25, &quot;Walmart&quot;); const Bob = new Student(&quot;Bob&quot;, 15, 10); const Joe = new Person(&quot;Joe&quot;, 36); console.log(`At ${Jhon.name}&#39;s job at ${Jhon.job}, they Jhon in a heated debate about the state of society Jhon said ${Jhon.greeting()}in sheer confusion Joe and his son Bob also began to say their greetings &quot;${Joe.greeting()}&quot; and &quot;${Bob.greeting()}&quot;`); . At John&#39;s job at Walmart, they Jhon in a heated debate about the state of society Jhon said Hello I work at Walmart and my name is John and I am 25 years old. My profression conusmes my life and I have no time for friends or family. I am a slave to foul beast known as capitalism.in sheer confusion Joe and his son Bob also began to say their greetings &#34;Hello my name is Joe and I am 36 years old&#34; and &#34;Hey my name is Bob and I am 15 years old and I am in grade 10!!&#34; . Sequences . Category: Managing Complexity with Variables | Definition: A sequence is an ordered collection of items where each item holds a relative position with respect to the others. Sequences are one of the most basic Python data types. There are four sequence types in Python: strings, lists, tuples, and range objects. Strings are immutable sequences of Unicode code points. Lists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of homogeneous items (where the precise degree of similarity will vary by application). Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data (such as the 2-tuples produced by the enumerate() built-in). Ranges are immutable sequences of numbers and are commonly used for looping a specific number of times in for loops. | . Sequences Code Example . Butters = [&quot;salted&quot;,&quot;unsalted&quot;,&quot;organic&quot;,&quot;peanut&quot;,&quot;almond&quot;,&quot;cashew&quot;] def Butter_Selecter(Butters): cost = 0 orders = [] print(&quot;We have these butters for sale:&quot;, end = &quot; &quot;) for butter in Butters: print(butter, end = &quot; &quot;) print() while True: rsp = input(&quot;What butter would you like to add to your order? (enter done when your are finished)&quot;) if rsp.lower().strip() in Butters: orders.append(rsp) elif rsp.lower().strip() == &quot;done&quot;: break else: print(&quot;Invalid choice. Please choose a butter from the list.&quot;) print(&quot;Your order is&quot;, end = &quot; &quot;) for order in orders: print(order, end = &quot; butter &quot;, sep = &quot; &quot;) cost += 26.33 # This is a gourmet butter price print(f&quot; nYour total cost is ${round(cost,2)}&quot;) Butter_Selecter(Butters) . We have these butters for sale: salted unsalted organic peanut almond cashew Invalid choice. Please choose a butter from the list. Your order is peanut butter almond butter salted butter unsalted butter organic butter Your total cost is $131.65 . Selection . Category: Managing Complexity with Variables | Definition: Selection is the ability to run certain blocks of code only after certain conditions are met this can be done through the use of conditional statements such as else, if, and elif in python or else if in other languges. Selection can be used to make decisions in a program. For instance if you were to make a program that would ask the user for their age and then print out a message based on their age. You could use selection to make it so that if the user is under 18 it would print out a message saying that they are not old enough to vote, if they are 18 or older it would print out a message saying that they are old enough to vote, and if they are 21 or older it would print out a message saying that they are old enough to drink. This can be used to make a program more interactive and allow it to be more dynamic. | . Selection Code Example . def LAN(): def guests(Type): amount = input(f&quot;How many {Type}s are at your LAN party?&quot;) if amount.strip().lower() == &quot;none&quot;: return 0 else: return int(amount) def names(Type, amount): names = [] for temp in range(amount): name = input(f&quot;What are the names of your {Type}s friends?&quot;) names.append(name) return names gamers = guests(&quot;gamer&quot;) non_gamers = guests(&quot;non gamer&quot;) party_goers = names(&quot;gamer&quot;, gamers) + names(&quot;non gamer&quot;, non_gamers) mountain_dew = 1.5 * gamers chips = 3*gamers + 0.25*non_gamers GT730 = non_gamers print(f&quot;You will need {mountain_dew} liters of Mountain Dew and {round(chips, 3)} kg of chips for your party along with {GT730} GT730 Gaming PCs&quot;) print(&quot;Your party goers are:&quot;, end = &quot; &quot;) print(*party_goers, sep = &quot;, &quot;) LAN() # Through the use of selction through the use of if and else statments the porgram is able to determine not prompt the user for their non-gamer/gamer # friends are present then display the amount of refreshments and special punishments (GT730s) need to be arranged for the party. . You will need 6.0 liters of Mountain Dew and 12.5 kg of chips for your party along with 2 GT730 Gaming PCs Your party goers are: Jhonno, Steve, Barry, Nansi Pelosi, Gary, Steve . def LAN(): def guests(Type): amount = input(f&quot;How many {Type}s are at your LAN party?&quot;) if amount.strip().lower() == &quot;none&quot;: return 0 else: return int(amount) def names(Type, amount): names = [] for temp in range(amount): name = input(f&quot;What are the names of your {Type}s friends?&quot;) names.append(name) return names gamers = guests(&quot;gamer&quot;) non_gamers = guests(&quot;non gamer&quot;) party_goers = names(&quot;gamer&quot;, gamers) + names(&quot;non gamer&quot;, non_gamers) mountain_dew = 1.5 * gamers chips = 3*gamers + 0.25*non_gamers GT730 = non_gamers print(f&quot;You will need {mountain_dew} liters of Mountain Dew and {round(chips, 3)} kg of chips for your party along with {GT730} GT730 Gaming PCs&quot;) print(&quot;Your party goers are:&quot;, end = &quot; &quot;) print(*party_goers, sep = &quot;, &quot;) LAN() # If there are no gamer friends at the LAN party . You will need 0.0 liters of Mountain Dew and 0.5 kg of chips for your party along with 2 GT730 Gaming PCs Your party goers are: berry, jerry . Iteration . Category: Managing Complexity with Variables | Definition: Iteration is the ability to run a block of code multiple times. This can be done through the use of loops. Loops are used to repeat a block of code. For instance if you were to make a program that would print out the numbers 1-10 you could use a loop to make it so that it would print out the numbers 1-10 without having to write out the print statement 10 times. This can be used to make a program more interactive and allow it to be more dynamic. | . Iteration Code Example . def On_The_Wall(): thing = input(&quot;What is on the wall?&quot;) amount = int(input(f&quot;How many {thing}s are on the wall?&quot;)) for item in range(amount, 0, -1): print(f&quot;{item} {thing}s on the wall, {item} {thing}s&quot;) print(f&quot;Take one down, pass it around, {item-1} {thing}s on the wall&quot;) On_The_Wall() # Through the use of iteration the program is able to print out the the # amount of items on the wall and then print out the amount of items on the wall # after one is taken down without having to print it manualy each time this allows # the program to simpler to write, read, and understand. . 5 cheeses on the wall, 5 cheeses Take one down, pass it around, 4 cheeses on the wall 4 cheeses on the wall, 4 cheeses Take one down, pass it around, 3 cheeses on the wall 3 cheeses on the wall, 3 cheeses Take one down, pass it around, 2 cheeses on the wall 2 cheeses on the wall, 2 cheeses Take one down, pass it around, 1 cheeses on the wall 1 cheeses on the wall, 1 cheeses Take one down, pass it around, 0 cheeses on the wall . Expresions . Category: Logical Operations &amp; Decision Making | Definition: An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators with can be evaluated to have different outcome occur. For instance if a certain number is greater than another number in a game the person that rolled the larger number would get a message saying that they won through the use of an expression. | . Expresions Code Example . import random def game(): num_rounds = int(input(&quot;Rounds: &quot;)) for i in range(num_rounds): player1_numbers = (random.randint(1, 6), random.randint(1, 6), random.randint(1, 6)) player2_numbers = (random.randint(1, 6), random.randint(1, 6), random.randint(1, 6)) if max(player1_numbers) &gt; max(player2_numbers): print(&quot;On round &quot;+ str(i+1) +&quot; Player 1 won with a score of &quot; + str(max(player1_numbers)) + &quot; compared to Player 2 with a score of &quot; + str(max(player2_numbers))) elif max(player1_numbers) &lt; max(player2_numbers): print(&quot;On round &quot;+ str(i+1) +&quot; Player 2 won with a score of &quot; + str(max(player2_numbers)) + &quot; compared to Player 1 with a score of &quot; + str(max(player1_numbers))) else: print(&quot;Both players tied with a score of &quot; + str(max(player1_numbers)) + &quot; on round &quot; + str(i)) game() # Through the use of expressions the program is abel to evaluate whether the # maximum value that the player rolled was larger or less thant the other # player then through that be able to print which player won the game # this would otherwise be impossible without the use of expressions. . On round 1 Player 1 won with a score of 4 compared to Player 2 with a score of 3 On round 2 Player 1 won with a score of 6 compared to Player 2 with a score of 4 . Comparsion Operators . Category: Logical Operations &amp; Decision Making | Definiton: Comparsion Operators are used to compare two or more values. Some of these operators in python include ==. !=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, and &lt;=. Which are equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to respectively. | . Comparsion Operators Code Example . import random words = [&quot;abstraction&quot;, &quot;access&quot;, &quot;adapter&quot;, &quot;algorithm&quot;, &quot;analyst&quot;, &quot;anomaly&quot;, &quot;architecture&quot;, &quot;array&quot;, &quot;artificial&quot;, &quot;attribute&quot;, &quot;backend&quot;, &quot;bandwidth&quot;, &quot;benchmark&quot;, &quot;binary&quot;, &quot;blockchain&quot;, &quot;boolean&quot;, &quot;breadth&quot;, &quot;bug&quot;, &quot;byte&quot;, &quot;cache&quot;, &quot;calculator&quot;, &quot;capacity&quot;, &quot;cartesian&quot;, &quot;category&quot;, &quot;cipher&quot;, &quot;classification&quot;, &quot;client&quot;, &quot;client-server&quot;, &quot;closure&quot;, &quot;cluster&quot;, &quot;code&quot;, &quot;cognitive&quot;, &quot;cohesion&quot;, &quot;command&quot;, &quot;comment&quot;, &quot;communication&quot;, &quot;compiler&quot;, &quot;complexity&quot;, &quot;component&quot;, &quot;computation&quot;, &quot;concurrency&quot;, &quot;configuration&quot;, &quot;connectivity&quot;, &quot;consistency&quot;, &quot;constraint&quot;, &quot;container&quot;, &quot;context&quot;, &quot;contingency&quot;, &quot;continuous&quot;, &quot;control&quot;, &quot;converter&quot;, &quot;coordination&quot;, &quot;core&quot;, &quot;correlation&quot;, &quot;cursor&quot;, &quot;data&quot;, &quot;database&quot;, &quot;debugging&quot;, &quot;declaration&quot;, &quot;decrement&quot;, &quot;definition&quot;, &quot;degradation&quot;, &quot;delegation&quot;, &quot;delimiter&quot;, &quot;density&quot;, &quot;derivation&quot;, &quot;descendant&quot;, &quot;design&quot;, &quot;detection&quot;, &quot;dictionary&quot;, &quot;dimension&quot;, &quot;directive&quot;, &quot;discrete&quot;, &quot;dispatch&quot;, &quot;distributed&quot;, &quot;divergence&quot;, &quot;dynamic&quot;, &quot;echo&quot;, &quot;encoding&quot;, &quot;encryption&quot;, &quot;endpoint&quot;, &quot;enumeration&quot;, &quot;environment&quot;, &quot;equation&quot;, &quot;error&quot;, &quot;event&quot;, &quot;exception&quot;, &quot;execution&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;, &quot;extraction&quot;, &quot;failure&quot;, &quot;fault&quot;, &quot;fetch&quot;, &quot;flow&quot;, &quot;fragment&quot;, &quot;function&quot;, &quot;gateway&quot;, &quot;generic&quot;, &quot;granularity&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;, &quot;hashing&quot;, &quot;heap&quot;, &quot;heuristic&quot;, &quot;hierarchy&quot;, &quot;hyperlink&quot;, &quot;identity&quot;, &quot;implementation&quot;, &quot;inclusion&quot;, &quot;increment&quot;, &quot;index&quot;, &quot;inference&quot;, &quot;inheritance&quot;, &quot;initialization&quot;, &quot;input&quot;, &quot;instance&quot;, &quot;instruction&quot;, &quot;interface&quot;, &quot;interoperability&quot;, &quot;iteration&quot;, &quot;key&quot;, &quot;keyword&quot;, &quot;label&quot;, &quot;latency&quot;, &quot;library&quot;, &quot;lifecycle&quot;, &quot;link&quot;, &quot;load&quot;, &quot;localization&quot;, &quot;logic&quot;, &quot;loop&quot;, &quot;machine&quot;, &quot;management&quot;, &quot;manipulation&quot;, &quot;mapping&quot;, &quot;matrix&quot;, &quot;measurement&quot;, &quot;method&quot;, &quot;middleware&quot;, &quot;migration&quot;, &quot;model&quot;, &quot;modification&quot;, &quot;module&quot;, &quot;monitoring&quot;] def word_game(words): player1_word = random.choice(words) player2_word = random.choice(words) player1_score = len(player1_word) player2_score = len(player2_word) if player1_score &gt; player2_score: print(f&quot;Player 1 wins as thier word {player1_word} is longer than Player 2&#39;s word {player2_word} by {player1_score - player2_score} letters&quot;) elif player2_score &gt; player1_score: print(f&quot;Player 2 wins as thier word {player2_word} is longer than Player 1&#39;s word {player1_word} by {player2_score - player1_score} letters&quot;) else: print(f&quot;Both players had words which were the same in length with a length of {player1_score} letters player 1&#39;s word was {player1_word} and player 2&#39;s word was {player2_word}&quot;) word_game(words) # Through the use of a comparsion operator the program is able to determine which player has the longest word and then print out # which player one and by how much longer their word was in comparsion so the other player. . Player 1 wins as thier word compiler is longer than Player 2&#39;s word failure by 1 letters . Boolean Expressions &amp; Selection . Category: Logical Operations &amp; Decision Making | Definition: Boolean Expressions are used to evaluate expressions are either True or False and can be used with selection statments such as if, and elif to make exucute certain blocks of code. | . Boolean Expressions &amp; Selection Code Example . def Citzenship_Checker(): age = int(input(&quot;What is your age?&quot;)) citzenship = input(&quot;What country are you a citzen of?&quot;) if age &gt;= 18 and citzenship.strip().lower() == &quot;New Zealand&quot;.strip().lower(): print(f&quot;You are {age} so you are able to vote in New Zealand&quot;) elif age &lt;= 18 and citzenship.strip().lower() == &quot;New Zealand&quot;.strip().lower(): print(f&quot;You are {age} so you are a minor but a citizen of New Zealand&quot;) else: print(f&quot;You are not a citizen of New Zealand but {citzenship} and are {age} years old.

You are not a citizen of New Zealand but Mexico and are 2 years old. Check the voting rules in Mexico to know if you can vote. . Booleans Expressions and Iteration . Category: Logical Operations &amp; Decision Making | Definition: Boolean Expressions can be used with iteration as they can be used as a loopoing condition so if the condition was true the loop would continue to run and if it was false the loop would stop running. Or you could make an infinite loop by making the condition always true. | . Booleans Expressions and Iteration Code Example . def pantry(): cookie_jar = int(input(&quot;How many cookies are in the pantry?&quot;)) end = int(input(&quot;How many cookies will you eat?&quot;)) limit = cookie_jar - end while cookie_jar &gt; limit: cookie_jar -= 1 print(f&quot;There are {cookie_jar} cookies left in the pantry after you ate {end} cookies and you gained {end*40} calories&quot;) pantry() . There are 33 cookies left in the pantry after you ate 2 cookies and you gained 80 calories . Truth Tables . Category: Logical Operations &amp; Decision Making | Definition: Truth tables show the results of combining boolean values to show the whether or not a condition can be true or false. For instance if you were to make a truth table for the condition of a person being able to vote you could make it so that the first column would be the age of the person and the second column would be whether or not they are a citizen. Then you could make it so that if the person is 18 or older and a citizen they can vote, if they are 18 or older and not a citizen they can not vote, if they are under 18 and a citizen they can not vote, and if they are under 18 and not a citizen they can not vote. This is an illustration of how truth tables can be used to make decisions in a program. However they can also be used when expressing other operations besides and such as or, not, and xor. | . Truth Tables Code Example . def Truth_Table(A, B): def Logic(A, B): AND = A and B OR = A or B NOT = not A XOR = A ^ B return AND, OR, NOT, XOR AND, OR, NOT, XOR = Logic(A, B) print(f&quot;{A} t{B} t{AND} t{OR} t{NOT} t{XOR}&quot;) print(&quot;A tB tAND tOR tNOT tXOR&quot;) Truth_Table(True, False) Truth_Table(False, True) Truth_Table(False, False) Truth_Table(True, True) # Through a Truth Table the program is able to # display the result of the logic gates AND, OR, NOT, # and XOR. Illustrating how each gate functions. . A B AND OR NOT XOR True False False True False True False True False True True True False False False False True False True True True True False False . Charectors . Category: Strings &amp; String Operations | Definition: A character is a symbol that represents a letter, number, or other character. They are used to represent all kinds of itmes including special charectors and spaces. Ex. !@#$%^&amp;*()_+{}|:&quot;&lt;&gt;?`~[] ;&#39;,./ are all charectors. Charectors can be stored in strings in python. | . Charectors Code Example . def charectors(): word = input(&quot;What is your word?&quot;) print(f&quot;Your word is {word}&quot;) for charector in word: print(f&quot;{charector} has the ASCII code {ord(charector)}&quot;) charectors() # This program showcases charectors stored in a string which it # then iterates through printing the ASCII code that each # charector correlates to. . Your word is butter b has the ASCII code 98 u has the ASCII code 117 t has the ASCII code 116 t has the ASCII code 116 e has the ASCII code 101 r has the ASCII code 114 . Strings . Category: Strings &amp; String Operations | Definition: Strings are a datatype that is used to store text in a program. For instance if you were to make a program that would ask the user for their name and then print out a message saying hello to them you could use a string to store the users name. | .

Category: Strings &amp; String Operations | Definition: Traversing a string is the ability to access each individual charector in a string. As each charector is an iterable object in python you can use a for loop to access each individual charector in a string. | . Traversing Strings Code Example . def seperator(): word = input(&quot;What is your word?&quot;) print(f&quot;Your orginal string was: {word}&quot;) print(&quot;Your seperated string is: &quot;) for charector in word: print(charector) seperator() # Through using a for loop the program is able # to iterate through the string and print each # charector on a new line. . Your orginal string was: butter Your seperated string is: b u t t e r . Python If . Category: Conditional Statements | Definition: The If statment is a conditional statement that is used to create condition if met will execute a block of code. For instance if you were to make a program that would prompt the user for a certain word if it was of a certain length it would print out a message saying that the word was of the correct length. | . Python If Code Example . def word_guesser(word_bank, word): if word in word_bank: print(f&quot;Your word {word} was in the word bank&quot;) else: print(f&quot;Your word {word} was not in the word bank&quot;) words = [&quot;abstraction&quot;, &quot;access&quot;, &quot;adapter&quot;, &quot;algorithm&quot;, &quot;analyst&quot;, &quot;anomaly&quot;, &quot;architecture&quot;, &quot;array&quot;, &quot;artificial&quot;, &quot;attribute&quot;, &quot;backend&quot;, &quot;bandwidth&quot;, &quot;benchmark&quot;, &quot;binary&quot;, &quot;blockchain&quot;, &quot;boolean&quot;, &quot;breadth&quot;, &quot;bug&quot;, &quot;byte&quot;, &quot;cache&quot;, &quot;calculator&quot;, &quot;capacity&quot;, &quot;cartesian&quot;, &quot;category&quot;, &quot;cipher&quot;, &quot;classification&quot;, &quot;client&quot;, &quot;client-server&quot;, &quot;closure&quot;, &quot;cluster&quot;, &quot;code&quot;, &quot;cognitive&quot;, &quot;cohesion&quot;, &quot;command&quot;, &quot;comment&quot;, &quot;communication&quot;, &quot;compiler&quot;, &quot;complexity&quot;, &quot;component&quot;, &quot;computation&quot;, &quot;concurrency&quot;, &quot;configuration&quot;, &quot;connectivity&quot;, &quot;consistency&quot;, &quot;constraint&quot;, &quot;container&quot;, &quot;context&quot;, &quot;contingency&quot;, &quot;continuous&quot;, &quot;control&quot;, &quot;converter&quot;, &quot;coordination&quot;, &quot;core&quot;, &quot;correlation&quot;, &quot;cursor&quot;, &quot;data&quot;, &quot;database&quot;, &quot;debugging&quot;, &quot;declaration&quot;, &quot;decrement&quot;, &quot;definition&quot;, &quot;degradation&quot;, &quot;delegation&quot;, &quot;delimiter&quot;, &quot;density&quot;, &quot;derivation&quot;, &quot;descendant&quot;, &quot;design&quot;, &quot;detection&quot;, &quot;dictionary&quot;, &quot;dimension&quot;, &quot;directive&quot;, &quot;discrete&quot;, &quot;dispatch&quot;, &quot;distributed&quot;, &quot;divergence&quot;, &quot;dynamic&quot;, &quot;echo&quot;, &quot;encoding&quot;, &quot;encryption&quot;, &quot;endpoint&quot;, &quot;enumeration&quot;, &quot;environment&quot;, &quot;equation&quot;, &quot;error&quot;, &quot;event&quot;, &quot;exception&quot;, &quot;execution&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;, &quot;extraction&quot;, &quot;failure&quot;, &quot;fault&quot;, &quot;fetch&quot;, &quot;flow&quot;, &quot;fragment&quot;, &quot;function&quot;, &quot;gateway&quot;, &quot;generic&quot;, &quot;granularity&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;, &quot;hashing&quot;, &quot;heap&quot;, &quot;heuristic&quot;, &quot;hierarchy&quot;, &quot;hyperlink&quot;, &quot;identity&quot;, &quot;implementation&quot;, &quot;inclusion&quot;, &quot;increment&quot;, &quot;index&quot;, &quot;inference&quot;, &quot;inheritance&quot;, &quot;initialization&quot;, &quot;input&quot;, &quot;instance&quot;, &quot;instruction&quot;, &quot;interface&quot;, &quot;interoperability&quot;, &quot;iteration&quot;, &quot;key&quot;, &quot;keyword&quot;, &quot;label&quot;, &quot;latency&quot;, &quot;library&quot;, &quot;lifecycle&quot;, &quot;link&quot;, &quot;load&quot;, &quot;localization&quot;, &quot;logic&quot;, &quot;loop&quot;, &quot;machine&quot;, &quot;management&quot;, &quot;manipulation&quot;, &quot;mapping&quot;, &quot;matrix&quot;, &quot;measurement&quot;, &quot;method&quot;, &quot;middleware&quot;, &quot;migration&quot;, &quot;model&quot;, &quot;modification&quot;, &quot;module&quot;, &quot;monitoring&quot;] word = input(&quot;What word do you want to check?&quot;) word_guesser(words, word) # Through the use of the if statement the program is able to execute # a block of code informing the user that thier word is in their # word is in the word bank or not if the condition that the word is # in the word bank is met. If it is not met the else statemtent # executes and informs the user that the word is not in the word bank. . Your word blockchain was in the word bank . Elif . Category: Conditional Statements | Defintion: Elif or Else If is a conditional statement that is used to create a condition if met will execute a block of code. However it is used after an if statement and can be used to create multiple conditions. An example could be if there was a correct word and you had a game where the user had to guess a word of the same length if their word was too long or too short it would print out a message saying that the word was too long or too short. | . Elif Code Example . def word_guesser(word): while True: guess = input(&quot;What word do you want to check?&quot;) if len(guess) == len(word): print(f&quot;Your guess {guess} was the correct length&quot;) break elif len(guess) &gt; len(word): print(f&quot;Your guess {guess} was too long&quot;) else: print(f&quot;Your guess {guess} was too short&quot;) word = &quot;abstraction&quot; word_guesser(word) # Through the use of elif statment the porgram is able to # Excute a different block of code depending on if a # another condition is true other than just having an # else statment in this case it woud alows the program # to check if the guess is too long or too short not just # if it is the wrong length. . Your guess truffles was too short Your guess butter was too short Your guess gamer was too short Your guess butterscotch was too long Your guess abstraction was the correct length . Else Conditionals . Category: Conditional Statements | Definiton: Else is a conditional statement that will execute if the other condtion is not met so if the condition of an if statement is not met it will execute the other block of code. | . Else Conditionals Code Example . def addition_game(numbers): num1 = int(input(&quot;What is your first number?&quot;)) num2 = int(input(&quot;What is your second number?&quot;)) if num1 + num2 in numbers: print(f&quot;Your answer {num1 + num2} was in the list of numbers&quot;) else: print(f&quot;Your answer {num1 + num2} was not in the list of numbers&quot;) numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] addition_game(numbers) # Through the use of the else statment the program is able to able # print that the sum of the users two numbers is not in the list of # numbers as the if condition that the sum of the two numbers is in # the list of numbers is not met. . Your answer 53 was not in the list of numbers . Nested Selection Statement . Category: Conditional Statements | Definition: Nested selection statements are used to allow for more complicated logic in programs so to create a condition if another condition is also true. | . Nested Selection Statement Code Example . def number_compare(num1, num2): if num1 &gt; num2: print(f&quot;Your first number {num1} was greater than your second number {num2}&quot;) if num1 &gt;0: print(&quot;Your first number was also positive&quot;) else: print(&quot;Your first number was also negative&quot;) if num2 &gt; 0: print(&quot;Your second number was also positive&quot;) else: print(&quot;Your second number was also negative&quot;) elif num1 &lt; num2: print(f&quot;Your first number {num1} was less than your second number {num2}&quot;) if num2 &gt; 0: print(&quot;Your second number was also positive&quot;) else: print(&quot;Your second number was also negative&quot;) if num1 &gt;0: print(&quot;Your first number was also positive&quot;) else: print(&quot;Your first number was also negative&quot;) else: print(f&quot;Your first number {num1} was equal to your second number {num2}&quot;) if num1 &gt; 0: print(&quot;Your numbers were also positive&quot;) else: print(&quot;Your numbers were also negative&quot;) number_compare(-1,1) # Through the use of having mutliple nested # selection statements the program is able to # determine which number is larger of the two # along with the sign of the numbers. This is # possible as the program can have multiple # if statements within the selection statements # allowing multiple sub-conditions to be met. # . Your first number -1 was less than your second number 1 Your second number was also positive Your first number was also negative . Python For . Category: Loops &amp; Iteration | Definition: The For loop is a loop that is used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. For instance you could write a program that would iterate through a list of numbers and print out each number in the list. | . Python For Code Example . wonders = [ (&quot;Great Pyramid of Giza&quot;, 29.9792, 31.1342), (&quot;Hanging Gardens of Babylon&quot;, 32.5350, 44.4270), (&quot;Temple of Artemis at Ephesus&quot;, 37.9279, 27.3506), (&quot;Statue of Zeus at Olympia&quot;, 37.6275, 21.6405), (&quot;Mausoleum of Halicarnassus&quot;, 37.0353, 27.4162), (&quot;Colossus of Rhodes&quot;, 36.4450, 28.2269), (&quot;Lighthouse of Alexandria&quot;, 31.2156, 29.9456)] def wonder_Location(wonders): for wonder in wonders: print(f&quot;{wonder[0]} is located at {wonder[1]}, {wonder[2]}&quot;) wonder_Location(wonders) # Through the use of a for loop the program is able to iterate through # the iterables in the list which are tuples and be able to print the # name of the wonder along with the latitude and longitude of the wonder. . Great Pyramid of Giza is located at 29.9792, 31.1342 Hanging Gardens of Babylon is located at 32.535, 44.427 Temple of Artemis at Ephesus is located at 37.9279, 27.3506 Statue of Zeus at Olympia is located at 37.6275, 21.6405 Mausoleum of Halicarnassus is located at 37.0353, 27.4162 Colossus of Rhodes is located at 36.445, 28.2269 Lighthouse of Alexandria is located at 31.2156, 29.9456 . While Loops With Range . Category: Loops &amp; Iteration | Definition: A while loops is a kind of loop that iterates while a condition is true this could be used with range in a way so you can iterate a certain number of times. For instance using this kind of loop you would be able to iterate only 5 times to only execute a certain block of code that amount of times such as a print statement. | . While Loops With Range Code Example . def printer(message): i = 0 while i &lt; 5: print(message) i += 1 printer(&quot;Hello World&quot;) # Through the use of a while loop # with range you are able to # print the message only 5 times . Hello World Hello World Hello World Hello World Hello World . List Combining Loops With Conditionals To Break . Category: Loops &amp; Iteration | Definition: You can combine loops with conditionals that could prematurly terminate that loop if it were to be iterating through a list if a certain condition was met. | . List Combining Loops With Conditionals To Break Code Example . words = [&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;, &quot;spam&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;] def word_search(words): loops = 0 for word in words: rsp = input(&quot;What word do you want to check?&quot;) if rsp.lower().strip() in words: print(f&quot;{rsp} was found after {loops} loops&quot;) break else: print(f&quot;{rsp} was not found after {loops} loops&quot;) loops += 1 word_search(words) # Through the use of a for loop which iterates # through the list of words and conditionals # within the program is able end the loop # once the word is found before the loop is done . gamer was not found after 0 loops butter was not found after 1 loops world was found after 2 loops . Continue . Category: Loops &amp; Iteration | Definition: Continue is a keyword which is used to skip the current iteration and move on to the next one. For instance if you were to make a program that would iterate through a list of numbers and print out all the even numbers you could use continue to skip the odd numbers. | . Continue Code Example . for i in range(10): if i % 2 ==0: continue print(i) # Through the use of the continue statement # the program is able to skip the even numbers # and only print the odd numbers . 1 3 5 7 9 . for i in range(10): if i % 2 == 0: print(i) # Without the use of the continue statement # The program only printed the even numbers # as without continue they were not skipped . 0 2 4 6 8 . Procedural Abstraction . Category: Algorythms | Definition: Procedural Abstraction is about creating a simplifed interface for a more complex operation. Which is done by breaking things up into smaller componenents and steps to be able to deal with complex problems more easily and also being able to resure code through spliting it up into smaller more managable functions. | . Procedural Abstraction Code Example . class numbers: def __init__(self, num1, num2): self.num1 = num1 self.num2 = num2 def number_adder(self): return self.num1 + self.num2 def number_subtractor(self): return self.num1 - self.num2 def number_multiplier(self): return self.num1 * self.num2 def number_divider(self): return round(self.num1 / self.num2, 2) def number_exponent(self): return self.num1 ** self.num2 def __str__(self): return f&quot;num1: {self.num1} and num2: {self.num2} are the numbers being used&quot; nums = numbers(3,7) print(nums) print(f&quot;The numbers added together is: {nums.number_adder()}&quot;) print(f&quot;The numbers subtracted together is: {nums.number_subtractor()}&quot;) print(f&quot;The numbers multiplied together is: {nums.number_multiplier()}&quot;) print(f&quot;The numbers divded from each other are: {nums.number_divider()}&quot;) print(f&quot;The num1 to the power of num2 is: {nums.number_exponent()}&quot;) # Through the use of procedural abstaction the more complex # functions are abstracted into smaller functions which are # easier to understand and read as well as being able to be # used by the user of the program. . num1: 3 and num2: 7 are the numbers being used The numbers added together is: 10 The numbers subtracted together is: -4 The numbers multiplied together is: 21 The numbers divded from each other are: 0.43 The num1 to the power of num2 is: 2187 . Python Def Procedures . Category: Algorythms | Definition: A def procedure is the way functions are defined in Python and are used to create blocks of code that perform certain actions which can be executed at a later date. For innstance you would be able to create a function using a def procedure that could add two numbers than call that function in other application during your program. | . Python Def Procedures Code Example . def hello_there(name): print(f&quot;Hello there {name}&quot;) def friend(): name = input(&quot;What is your name?&quot;) hello_there(name) friend() friend() # Through the use of a def procudure the # same block of code is able to be used # multiple times without having to rewrite # the same code over and over again. # Seen in the way both people could be # greeted with the same code. . Hello there Jhonny Silverstone Hello there Jhonny Appleseed . Parameters . Category: Algorythms | Definition: Parameters are variables that are used to pass information into a function. For instance if you were to make a function that would add two numbers the parameters of the function would be the two values. | . Parameters Code Example . def number_adder(num1, num2): print(f&quot;{num1} and {num2} added together is: {num1 + num2}&quot;) def number_subtractor(num1, num2): print(f&quot;{num1} subtracted by {num2} is: {num1 - num2}&quot;) number_adder(33,27) number_subtractor(69,420) # Through the adding and subtraction # functions it can be seen through # the use of parameters in the values # that are passed through the functions # that are able to be used in the functions # to be able to perform thier repective operations. . 33 and 27 added together is: 60 69 subtracted by 420 is: -351 . Return Values . Category: Algorythms | Definition: Return values are values that are returned from a function once it has completed exeuction. For instance if you were to create function which added two numbers together once the function had completed execution it would return the sum of the two numbers. In Python this is represented by the return keyword. | . Return Values Code Example . class Rectangle: def __init__(self, length, width, height): self.length = length self.width = width self.height = height def volume (self): volume = self.length * self.width * self.height return volume def surface_area(self): surface_area = 2 * (self.length * self.width + self.length * self.height + self.width * self.height) return surface_area def __str__(self): return f&quot;Rectanglular Prism: {self.length} ft x {self.width} ft x {self.height} ft&quot; rect = Rectangle(2,3,4) print(rect) print(f&quot;Volume: {rect.volume()} ft^3&quot;) print(f&quot;Surface Area: {rect.surface_area()} ft^2&quot;) # Through the use of return statmnts in the functions # the program is able to return the values of the # created for are and volume respectively after the # functions has completed executing. Which allows # the program to be able to print the values the # functions return. . Rectanglular Prism: 2 ft x 3 ft x 4 ft Volume: 24 ft^3 Surface Area: 52 ft^2 .",

Boolean | ASCII | Unicode | RGB | . Data Compression: . Lossless | Lossy | . Bits . Category: Data Terms | Definition: A bit is the smallest unit of data in a computer. It can have one of two values: 0 or 1. Can store all types of data. | . Bits Code Example . def DecimalToBinary(n): binary_digits = [] while n &gt; 0: binary_digits.append(n % 2) n = n // 2 return &#39;&#39;.join(str(d) for d in reversed(binary_digits)) print(DecimalToBinary(10)) # Output: 1010 print(DecimalToBinary(100)) # Output: 1100100 print(DecimalToBinary(255)) # Output: 11111111 . 1010 1100100 11111111 . Bytes . Category: Data Terms | Defintion: A byte is a group of 8 bits. It is the smallest unit of data that can be directly addressed by a computer. | . Bytes Code Example . string = &quot;Hello, world!&quot; byte_object = bytes(string, &quot;utf-8&quot;) print(byte_object) # Output: b&#39;Hello, world!&#39; print(f&quot;Number of bytes: {len(byte_object)}&quot;) # Output: Number of bytes: 13 # Byte back to string string = byte_object.decode(&quot;utf-8&quot;) print(string) # Output: Hello, world! . b&#39;Hello, world!&#39; Number of bytes: 13 Hello, world! . Hexadecimal . Category: Data Terms | Definition: A hexadecimal number is a number expressed in base 16 similar to decimal which is expressed in base 10. This means that each place represents a power of 16. The letters A-F are used to reprsent the values which are greater than 0-9 so A = 10, B = 11, etc. It is a convenient way to represent a byte value. Each hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits. | . Hexadecimal Code Example . hex_string = input(&quot;Enter a hexadecimal number: &quot;) decimal_num = int(hex_string, 16) binary_num = bin(decimal_num) print(&quot;Hexadecimal number:&quot;, hex_string) print(&quot;Decimal equivalent:&quot;, decimal_num) print(&quot;Binary equivalent:&quot;, binary_num) # what this code does is that it takes an input # from the user of a hexadecimal string then # converts that code to a decimal number using # the bin and int functions as they are just # different methods of storing data . Hexadecimal number: 0xA5 Decimal equivalent: 165 Binary equivalent: 0b10100101 . Nibbles . Category: Data Terms | Definition: A nibble is a group of 4 bits. It is half of a byte. It is often used to represent a single digit in a hexadecimal number (as each hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits). A high nibble is the most significant 4 bits of a byte. A low nibble is the least significant 4 bits of a byte. | . Nibbles Code Example . byte = 0xA5 # Extract the high nibble (the four most significant bits) # uses the bitwise right shift operator so that is shifts # the most 4 most important bits(high nibble) to the right # discard the 4 less significant bits (low nibble) high_nibble = byte &gt;&gt; 4 # Extract the low nibble (the four least significant bits) # through the use of the bitwise and operator as the 0x0F # represents the last for bits thus through the program it # does the inverse of what the first portion does and extracts # the 4 least significant bits which would be the low nibble low_nibble = byte &amp; 0x0F # Convert the nibbles to hexadecimal strings high_nibble_hex = hex(high_nibble) low_nibble_hex = hex(low_nibble) # Print the results print(&quot;Byte:&quot;, byte) print(&quot;High nibble:&quot;, high_nibble_hex) print(&quot;Low nibble:&quot;, low_nibble_hex) . Byte: 165 High nibble: 0xa Low nibble: 0x5 . Unsigned Integer . Category: Binary Numbers | Definition: An unsigned integer is a number that can only be positive. It is represented in binary using the same number of bits as the number of bits in the computer&#39;s word size. For example, a 32-bit computer uses 32 bits to represent an unsigned integer. So an unsigned integer can only be used in situations where the number used cannot be negative so in senarios like a shopping list where the number of groceries you need to buy cannot be negative. The advantages to using an unsigned integer is that it is faster to compute than a signed integer and it is easier to store in memory. The disadvantages are that it can only be used in situations where the number cannot be negative and it can only represent positive numbers making it prone to overflow errors if the number is implemented incorrectly in situation where there can be negative numbers such as a subtraction problem. | . Unsigned Integer Code Example . FYI: Python doesn&#39;t have unsigned integers so the ctypes module needs to be imported. | . from ctypes import c_uint shopping_list = [] # Declares an unsigned integer to store the numbers in the shopping list this is done as the list cannot have negative numbers # Making it it better than a signed integer in this case as this case is more appropriate for a shopping list item_count = c_uint(0) # Function to add an item to the shopping list def add_item(item): global item_count shopping_list.append(item) item_count.value += 1 print(f&quot; n{item} added to shopping list.&quot;) # Function to remove an item from the shopping list this prevents an overflow error # From occuring as the check in the remove items function makes it so that if only if the # number of items in the shopping list is greater than 0 can an item be removed # this prevents the number of items in the shopping list from going below 0 # thus eleminating the possiblity of an overflow error occuring def remove_item(item): global item_count if item in shopping_list: shopping_list.remove(item) if item_count.value &gt; 0: item_count.value -= 1 else: item_count.value = 0 print(&quot; nItem count is set to 0 cannot have a negative number of items in the shopping list.&quot;) print(f&quot; n{item} removed from shopping list.&quot;) else: print(f&quot; n{item} not found in shopping list.&quot;) # Add some items to the shopping list add_item(&quot;Milk&quot;) add_item(&quot;Bread&quot;) add_item(&quot;Eggs&quot;) # Prints the current shopping list print(f&quot; nCurrent shopping list: {shopping_list}&quot;) # Remove an item from the shopping list remove_item(&quot;Bread&quot;) # Print the current shopping list print(f&quot; nCurrent shopping list: {shopping_list}&quot;) # Try to remove an item that is not in the shopping list remove_item(&quot;Sugar&quot;) .

Category: Binary Numbers | Definition: A signed integer is a number that can be positive or negative. It is represented in binary using the same number of bits as the number of bits in the computer&#39;s word size. For example, a 32-bit computer uses 32 bits to represent a signed integer. So a signed integer can be used in situations where the number used can be negative so in senarios like a subtraction problem where the output can be either negative or postive where only integers are used. The advantages to using a signed integer is that it can be used in situations where the number can be negative and it can represent positive and negative numbers. The disadvantages are that it is slower to compute than an unsigned integer and it is more difficult to store in memory. Also compared to an unsigned integer, smaller numbers can be stored in the same amount of space but are more efficient than floating point numbers. | . Signed Integer Code Example . def subtractor(): num1 = int(input(&quot;Enter first number: &quot;)) num2 = int(input(&quot;Enter second number: &quot;)) print(f&quot;The difference between {num1} and {num2} is {num1 - num2}&quot;) subtractor() # As illustrated it can be seen as through the use of a # signed integer the program is able to store and dispaly # negative values as well as positive values # if an unsigned integer would have been used # in this senario the program would have had an overflow error . The difference between 21 and 69 is -48 . Floating Point . Category: Binary Numbers | Definition: A floating point number is a number that can be positive or negative and can have a decimal point. It is represented in binary using the same number of bits as the number of bits in the computer&#39;s word size. For example, a 32-bit computer uses 32 bits to represent a floating point number. So a floating point number can be used in situations where the number used can be negative and can have a decimal point so in senarios like a temperature where the temperature can be negative and can have a decimal point. The advantages to using a floating point number is that it can be used in situations where the number can be negative and can have a decimal point and it can represent positive and negative numbers. The disadvantages are that it is slower to compute than an unsigned and signed integer and it is more difficult to store in memory. Also compared to an unsigned and signed integer, smaller numbers can be stored in the same amount of space. | . Floating Point Code Example . def convertFahrenheit(temperature): celsius = temperature - 32 celsius = celsius * 5/9 print(f&quot; nThe temperature outside is {round(celsius, 7)} degrees celsius&quot;) outsideTemp = input(&quot;Enter temperature in celsius&quot;) outsideTemp = float(outsideTemp) print(f&quot; nThe tempreature outside is {outsideTemp} degrees farenheit&quot;) convertFahrenheit(outsideTemp) # As seen the program can handle both postive and negative numbers # Along with decimals as well as whole numbers # This is due to the fact that the program is using a floating number # This is best when there is divsion involved such as the tempreature # conversion as it allows the program to be able to display # information with more precision than if an integer was used . The tempreature outside is 21.21 degrees farenheit The temperature outside is -5.9944444 degrees celsius . Boolean . Category: Binary Data Abstractions | Definition: A boolean is a data type that can only have two values: True or False. So it can be used in programs such as conditional statments to determine if a certain condition is true or false it can excute a certain actions. There are many procedures that output a boolean value. | . Boolean Code Example . things = [1, 2.0, &quot;snowflake&quot;, True, 4, 5.0, &quot;butterfly&quot;, False, 7, 8.0, &quot;pumpernickle toast&quot;, True, 10, 11.0, &quot;rainbow&quot;, False] def thingchecker(things): for thing in things: # Had to add this portion as it seems that booleans and # integers are both considered integers in python for some reason # as it turns out that is because booleans are a subclass of integers if isinstance(thing, int) and not isinstance(thing, bool): print(f&quot;{thing} is an integer&quot;) elif isinstance(thing, float): print(f&quot;{thing} is a float&quot;) elif isinstance(thing, str): print(f&quot;{thing} is a string&quot;) elif isinstance(thing, bool): print(f&quot;{thing} is a boolean&quot;) else: print(&quot;The input is something else&quot;) thingchecker(things) . 1 is an integer 2.0 is a float snowflake is a string True is a boolean 4 is an integer 5.0 is a float butterfly is a string False is a boolean 7 is an integer 8.0 is a float pumpernickle toast is a string True is a boolean 10 is an integer 11.0 is a float rainbow is a string False is a boolean . ASCII . Category: Binary Data Abstractions | Definition: ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. It uses 7 bits to represent 128 different characters. It is the most common character encoding standard. It is used to represent text in computers and other devices. It is a subset of the Unicode character encoding standard. And is used for things such as data trasmission, to format files, is the base of languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python, and is used to represent text in HTML and XML documents, along with many more uses. | . ASCII Code Example . Coded = input(&quot;Enter a string to be coded: &quot;) print(f&#39;Your string was {Coded} which in ASCII codes is:&#39;) def ASCII_Coder(Coded): for letter in Coded: print(ord(letter), end = &quot; &quot;) ASCII_Coder(Coded) # The ord function is used to convert # a character into its ASCII code which # is then printed out to the user this # would also do genereal Unicode as well . Your string was butter which in ASCII codes is: 98 117 116 116 101 114 . Unicode . Category: Binary Data Abstractions | Definition: Unicode is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. It uses 16 bits to represent 65,536 different characters. It is the most common character encoding standard. It is used to represent text in computers and other devices. It is a superset of the ASCII character encoding standard. Representing the standard that encodes most of the worlds languages. | . Unicode Code Example . Coded = input(&quot;Enter a string to be coded: &quot;) print(f&#39;Your string was {Coded} which in ASCII codes is:&#39;) def Uni_Coder(Coded): for letter in Coded: print(ord(letter), end = &quot; &quot;) Uni_Coder(Coded) # According to google trasnlate that should be Hello World in Chinese Simplified # The program is able to convert the string into its Unicode code pointers # Which is the same code as the ASCII code as the ASCII code is a subset of the Unicode code # and the ord() function is able to convert the string into its Unicode code pointers . Your string was 你好世界 which in ASCII codes is: 20320 22909 19990 30028 . RGB . Category: Binary Data Abstractions | Definition: RGB stands for Red, Green, Blue. It is a color model that uses 3 bytes to represent 16,777,216 different colors. It is used to represent colors in computers and other devices. It is used to represent colors in images, videos, and other media. It is used to represent colors in HTML and CSS documents. | . RGB Code Example . BTW here is the picture the values are from: . from PIL import Image # Opens the image file doughnut = Image.open(&quot;/home/tirth/vscode/APCSP-Blog/images/Profile.jpg&quot;) # Get the width and height of the image width, height = doughnut.size center_x = width // 2 quarter_y = height // 4 # Get the color of the pixel at the center of the image # and a quarter of the way down from the top of the image r, g, b = doughnut.getpixel((center_x, quarter_y)) # gets the color of the pixel print(f&quot;Red: {r}&quot;) print(f&quot;Green: {g}&quot;) print(f&quot;Blue: {b}&quot;) . Red: 255 Green: 139 Blue: 184 . Lossless . Category: Data Compression | Definition: A lossless data compression algorithm is an algorithm that compresses data without losing any information as it can be reconstructed exactly from its compressed form. This type of compression is used for things like text files, certain image formats, and audo codecs such as FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec) seen in the refrence to compression in audiofile communties where a small subset of people can audibly dicern the differences in compression as indicated in them preferring to listen to FLACs and other simlar types of files, along with data bases, and many more uses. | . Lossy . Category: Data Compression | Definition: A lossy data compression algorithm is an algorithm that compresses data by removing some information. It is not reversible and the original data cannot be reconstructed exactly from its compressed form. This is done to be able to compress the data more efficiently. This type of compression is used in things such as audio and video compression where some quaility is loss is able to be tolerated. Some may be able to dicern the differnece in compression see above for more info. | . Lossless and Lossy Compression Code Example . As seen, the lossy image is orders of magnitude smaller than the lossless image, around 7.55 times smaller in fact (see the code below). This is due to the fact that lossy compression is able to remove some of the data from the image to achieve more efficient compression, unlike lossless compression, which is able to compress the image without removing any data. This is why the use of lossy compression, when possible, can save costs in commercial applications. As seen in the implementation of lossy compression in software such as Apple Music and Spotify, where lossy compression is used for most songs and non-premium users. Can you tell the difference between the lossy and lossless image? . Orginal Image: . Lossy Compressed Image: . Lossless Compressed Image: . import os from PIL import Image # Opens the image file same one as before with Image.open(&quot;/home/tirth/vscode/APCSP-Blog/images/Profile.jpg&quot;) as image: # Save the image using lossy JPEG compression image.save(&quot;image_compressed_lossy.jpg&quot;, &quot;JPEG&quot;, quality=75) # Save the image using lossless PNG compression image.save(&quot;image_compressed_lossless.png&quot;, &quot;PNG&quot;) # Get the file sizes of the compressed images lossy_size = os.path.getsize(&quot;image_compressed_lossy.jpg&quot;) lossless_size = os.path.getsize(&quot;image_compressed_lossless.png&quot;) # Prints the file sizes print(f&quot;Lossy image size: {lossy_size} bytes&quot;) print(f&quot;Lossless image size: {lossless_size} bytes&quot;) . Lossy image size: 106523 bytes Lossless image size: 803895 bytes .",

            "content": "3.17: Algorithm Efficiency . Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to help students understand how to make an efficient program and optimize it and understand its importance to the CSP curriculum. . What is Algorithmic Efficiency? . The ability of an algorithm to solve a problem in an efficient way An efficient algorithm solves a problem quickly and with a minimum amount of resources, such as time and memory. | . | How do we determine if an algorithm is efficient or not? One way we can do this is by determining the time complexity of the algorithm. | Another way is through space complexity. | . | . Traveling Merchant Problem Hacks: . What did you and your team discuss? (record below) . An heuristic solution is an approach to a problem that produces a solution that isn&#39;t necessarily optimal but can be used when normal methods take forever | . Describe the method used to solve the traveling merchant problem. (record below) . The way you would approach solving the travelling merchant problem is to view each as separate problems and then combine them together as in you should try and visualize the shortest routes you can take to get to each city from your starting point and then do the same approach to each of the cities you visit and then combine them together to get the shortest route possible or at least you get a very close approximation to the shortest route possible. | . 3.18: Undecidable Problems . Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concept of undecidable problems in computer science and to explain why these problems are important. . Key vocabulary: . Decision problem | Decidable problem | Undecidable problem | . Decision Problem . A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: . Decidable Problems | Undecidable Problems | . A decidable problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not. . An undecidable problem problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem. . Decidable Problems . A decidable problem is an algorithm that can always have an output of yes or no given any input. It is always correct. . Example of a Decidable Problem . The procedure below tests to see if a number is divisible by 13. If it is, it returns true. If it isn&#39;t, it returns false. . def divideThirteen(number): if number % 13 == 0: return True else: return False print(divideThirteen(26)) print(divideThirteen(30)) . True False . Undecidable Problems . An Example of a Forever Running Code . The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer(This is not the python data type &quot;integer&quot;, it&#39;s the integer in number theory). However, there is no end to this code, making the computer run forever. There is no halt to the code. . i = 0 number = 1 def integerTest(n): # Testing if the number is an integer if n%1 ==0: return True else: return False # Using while loop to keep searching an a non-integer above 1. Note that the computer runs forever. while i == 0: number += 1 if integerTest(number) == False: i +=1 print(&quot;Done&quot;) . The Halting Problem . The halting problem is an example of an undecidable problem. It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever. . There is no way to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether a body of code can run forever or not. . Halting Problem Example: . In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let&#39;s call this algorithm HaltChecker. | HaltChecker analyzes the program,program P, and its input,input I. If program P halts with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;halts&quot;. If program P doesn&#39;t halt(runs forever) with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the code runs forever, so HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. | Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses HaltChecker&#39;s output. So, if &quot;never&quot; is the output of HaltChecker, then the output of Reverser is &quot;halts&quot;. It&#39;s also the same the other way around: if HaltChecker has an output of &quot;halts&quot;, then Reverser has an output of &quot;never&quot;. | We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code. | Since Reverser is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints &quot;never&quot; when in fact there is an end(As proved by HaltChecker), and how it also prints &quot;halts&quot; when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by HaltChecker). As a result, HaltChecker is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem. | . This Diagram Sums up the Entire Process in the Bulleted List: . Credits of diagram and example to Khan Academy . FAQ . Q: If Reverser is causing the problem, why not remove it? | A: Removing Reverser will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate. | . Extra Things to Notice . Note that while a computer may take a long time to run a section of code, it does not mean that the computer is going to run forever. | Humans are able to solve some undecidable problems. The entire Halting Problem example was to prove that computers cannot solve undecidable problems. | . Hacks . Come up with one situation in which a computer runs into an undecidable problem. Explain why it is considered an undecidable problem. . An example of an undecidable program is the following: Such as the example of a store owner who wants to design a store that sells certain goods however there is not an algorithm that can determine how it should be done as it cannot predict the flow of customers the demand for certain products and the amount of money that will be made. This is an undecidable problem because there is no way to predict the best store layout or the different factors that will affect the store making it an undecidable problem. . 3.17 Homework . Your homework for Algorithmic Efficiency is pretty simple. . Use the 1st code below and graph it (Desmos, TI Inpire Cas, e.t.c), change the x value only! | Label the number of loops done as x and the time (microseconds) to find the index as y | Connect the points | Do the same thing with the 2nd code | Compare the two graphs and explain which one of the two is more efficient and why (min. 2 sentences) | Insert images of the graph either in your blog or on review ticket | import time def linear_search(lst, x): start_time = time.perf_counter_ns() # records time (nanoseconds) for i in range(len(lst)): # loops through the entire list if lst[i] == x: # until the x value we are looking for is found end_time = time.perf_counter_ns() # records time again total_time = (end_time - start_time) // 1000 # subtracts last recorded time and first recorded time print(&quot;Found element after {} loops in {} microseconds&quot;.format(i+1, total_time)) # prints the results return print(&quot;Your number was found at&quot;, i) end_time = time.perf_counter_ns() # records the time again total_time = (end_time - start_time) // 1000 # subtracts last recorded time and first recorded time print(&quot;Element not found after {} loops in {} microseconds&quot;.format(len(lst), total_time)) # prints the results return &quot;Your number wasn&#39;t found :(&quot; lst = list(range(1, 10001)) # list with numbers 1-10000 x = 1 # replace with an integer between 1 and 10000 (I suggest big numbers like 500, 2000, so on) linear_search(lst, x) # runs procedure .

As illustrated in the graphs is appears that the second function appears to be that the first graph appears to have smaller slop when a linear regression is created based on their data when comparing larger values for their inputs. If the function do not scale with linear time complexity there may be errors in my results however it seems that second funtion is more effiecint than the first function as the values get larger and can produce an output in less time however the first function is more effiecint when the input is smaller as it can produce an output in less time. . 3.18 Homework: .

This is useful for if you wanted a visual representation of a falling object, which pure math can&#39;t do as smoothly. . height = float(input(&quot;height in meters?&quot;)) weight = input(&quot;weight in pounds?&quot;) stuff = (2 * (height / 9.8))**(1/2) print(&quot;It will take&quot;, stuff,&quot;seconds for an object that weighs&quot;,weight,&quot;pounds&quot;,&quot;to fall &quot;,height,&quot;meters in a vacuum&quot;) . t = 0 g = 0 d = 0 false = True while false: t = t + 0.1 d = 9.8 / 2 * (t**2) if d &gt;= height: false = False #print(d) # if you want to print the distance every time it calculates it. Too long to output to a terminal, but this could be useful to display graphically. #print(t) print(t) print(d) . Simulation 2: . This simulation is made in order to simulate movement on a 2d plane vs a 3d plane. . | How it works: we have multiple variables, if statements and equations under a while command in order to randomy generate steps on a 2d plane. Once it reaches the set destination, it will say that the man made it home after x amount of steps. . | For the 3D plane, it takes a lot longer due to how big and open the 3d environment is, so there are more if statements in the 3d plane . | .

Simulations in the wild . Simulations are used extremely frequently in real life applications. One of the most common examples of simulations are video games. A games physics engine can accurately simulate objects colliding . Another example is Blender, the software used in 3d animations class, here at Del Norte. Blender is made up of many small simulations, but one big one it uses is simulating the way light bounces off of and interacts with objects. . Example Simulations . An example of a simulation is like the part seen in the image below made in Autodesk Inventor. Which represents a simulation as simlar to the render in blender it simulates the way light bounces off of and interacts with the object to simulate the reflections it casts on surounding objects and surfaces. Along with the way the light interacts with the object itself and how it creates shadows an aspect not seen in the image is the hole beneath it but using similar simulations the it understands that there will be darker shawdows and lesss reflections in the hole. Also using simulations to handle the way the material appears based on its texture and color accounting for the different ways light interacts with the material specifically. . . HW !!! . Create a simulation. It can be anything, just has to simulate something. . Some ideas: . Two objects colliding | Gravity on other planets | . AND .

A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arugments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value, then you will assign that value to a variable | .

            "content": "3.9 Part 1 . The lesson will start off with introducing what algorithms are and what they do, moreover, what their significance is. . 3.9 Lesson 1 has the objective to teach the student of the outcome of similar algorithmic concepts and similar algorithms. In this lesson, you will see different ways on how algorithms are developed. . Lesson 1 | Defining Algorithms . What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed through CODE. There are set limitations, this is what makes algorithms fun, you can your imagination and create whatever you wan with your own instructions! . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks . | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results. . | Some conditional statements can be written as the same as Boolean expressions (VICE VERSA) . | Different algorithms can be developed or use to solve the same problem. . | . Example 1 | What happens if we test the algorithm with different outputs? . The pseudocode above is translated to python for you. . Record what your outputs are when you enter 95 degrees F, does the algorithm yield the same result? . The conditional below is nested . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then 95, what do you notice? # It will print that it is too cold to play outside . It is too cold outside! . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then 95, what do you notice? # It will print that it is too hot to play outside . It&#39;s too hot outside! . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) elif (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then Input 95, what do you notice? # It prints that is both too hot to be outside and that it&#39;ll play out side this could be corrected with the above changes # If 54 was inputted it would correctly print that it is too cold to play outside . It&#39;s too hot outside! Sure I will play outside! . NOW RECORD with another output . Record what your outputs are when you enter 54, does the algorithm yield the same result this time? . *Now use 95 as an input for the two code blocks above. . Even though an algorithm&#39;s code can look the same, you have to be careful, they can always yield different results. When constructing algorithms you want to make sure that your code corresponds with what you want as your output. You set the limit of your code and you decide what the code&#39;s output is. . Conditionals vs. Booleans . The condition and instructions are what differ, that&#39;s where the magic happens. The condition is a boolean expression when an expression outputs either true or false. Boolean values are another type of data type in programming languages, and they can only ever hold true or false. . Exercise . Learning how to utilize conditionals and booleans are important for developing algorithms. Use this exercise to help you. . Can either Boolean expression on the right replace the conditional on the left? Assume isWeekday and isHoliday are Boolean variables. . *NOTE = you can edit the variables to check the conditions needed! . IsHoliday = False IsWeekday = True if IsHoliday: driveWork = True else: if IsWeekday: driveWork = True else: driveWork = False print(driveWork) . Logically thinking about conditionals and booleans . Now the problem may seem confusing, but the best way to develop an algorithm is to think about all the possible results that can be potentially be outputted. . So if IsHoliday is set to true, then driveWork is automatically equal to false and it does not matter what value of isWeekday is. This must mean that one of the conditionals must be NOT IsHoliday. . In the case that lets say IsHoliday is set to false, then the variable for weekday needs to be checked. If it&#39;s true then driveWork is true, if it&#39;s false then driveWork is false. This must mean that the other conditional isWeekday. . Combining both conditionals, you get option 2, which is not IsHoliday and IsWeekday. This is why option 2 is right! . Example 3 | Conditionals vs Booleans . The following algorithms are intended to sum the odd numbers from 1-9. Which algorithms work as intended? . Below, I have translated the block code into python, import this to your jupyter notebook and record the result. What do you notice? . First block . sum = 1 counter = 3 #iteration var = 0 while (var &lt; 4): #while the var is &lt;= 4, it executes those commands, once it exceeds it hits the else command sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 var = var + 1 # now go through the whole thing 4 times, this is an iteration, a vital part of algorithms. else: print(sum) . 25 . Second block . sum = 0 counter = 9 #iteration while (counter &gt;= 1): sum = sum + counter counter = counter - 2 print(sum) . 25 . When we start our initializing left sum as 1 counter as 3 we had no iterations yet. Remember we&#39;re going to have to repeat this four times because the block code prompts us to repeat 4 times, so we iterate. So as we go through and follow what the block gives us. . So you see that the sum does work, it does sum up the odd numbers from 1-9 . Now lets look at the right block. . Sum is set to 0 Counter is set to 9 We must repeat until the counter &lt; 1 is true. . So we keep adding until -1, that is when the counter &lt; 1 is true, so we stop . So why is it important to understand that algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same task? . An algorithm is beautiful that way, just because you think of solving a problem differently, doesn&#39;t mean your wrong, . 3.9 Part 2 . Flowcharts . Flowcharts can help you visualize the functionality of an algorithm . | They are a good way to double check whether or not your algorithm is achieving its purpose . | . How To Set Up A Flowchart . label the start point . | Define any and all variables you may need . | Consider the first question you want the algorithm to ask . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is yes (or true) . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is no (or false) . Steps 3-5 are the steps to creating code that uses a process called selection (you can convert the question from step 3 to a conditional if-statement in code) | . | Write out all necessary steps for the algorithm to function properly . | You may want your algorithm to iterate some steps until a condition is met . You can write the steps that need to be repeated, then draw an arrow from the last step to a step above that contains a conditional statement | . | determine a way to reach the end goal | Selection vs. Iteration . Selection: . A process used in algorithms where a conditional if-statement leads to one of two outcomes . Outcome 1: if the conditional statement is true, something will happen . | Outcome 2: if the conditional statement is false, something else will happen . | Ex: see example A . | . | . | Iteration . A process used in algorithms that allows certain things to happen until a condition is satisfied . Once the condition is satisfied, then an outcome is produced . | This can take the form of a for-loop, while-loop, and/or if-statement . | . | . | . Example A . Consider this situation: . You are shopping for your favorite food at your favorite supermarket . | You see that there is a sale on wheat products for 35% off . | There is another sale on produce for 20% off . | These sales are mutually exclusive . | Tax on all items is 8% . | . | Your TASK: . Create a flowchart for an algorithm that can be used to calculate the cost of your favorite item | . | . Example A Possible Solution (using Selection) . 3.9 Part 3 . For Algorithms How to combine and/or modify an existing algorithm. | . | . Benefits of combining algorithms can reduce development time, testing time, and simplify the identification of errors. | . | . Example in Class . Rules . step/rule 1: start with any positive integer | step/rule 2: if the preceding term is even; divide by 2 | step/rule 3: if the preceding term is odd; multiply by 3 and add 1 | step/rule 4: repeat steps until you arrive at 1 | fact: the sequence should ALWAYS end up at 1 if repeated. | . Algorithm to Start (Determining Whether a Number is Even or Odd) . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) if (varx %2 == 0): print(&quot;the number is even&quot;) else: print(&quot;the number is odd&quot;) # Run this cell to see how it works .

Takeaways . You can use code you&#39;ve previously wrote in order to make a project easier. | Breaking algorithms down into steps can make things easier and more simple. | . Hacks . create another algorithm using a famous mathematical algorithm such as the &quot;collatz conjecture.&quot; and explain your steps in a post on a blog. | . 3.11 Binary Search . Goals/Objectives: . detirmine number of iterations required to find vlue in data set. | explain requirements for binary search | . What is Binary Search? . Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. | An algorithm for iterating to find a value inside a data set | . About Binary Search: . Binary Search Algorithm starts in the middle of a data set of numbers and eliminates half the data. This process reapeats until the desired value is found or until all elements have been eliminated. | In order to use binary search effectivly and properly, data must be stored in order | COLLEGE BOARD INDEX STARTS AT 1 NOT 0 | . Think about how you would you would try to find a certain number in this set. . One way would be to line up the numbers and count them individually untill you find the desired value. . When working with large data sets with lots of numbers, methods like these wont work . Instead, a Binary Search would be more effective. | . Here we can see the numbers are set in an increasing order. Setting numbers in an increasing or decreasing is needed for a binary search . Binary search is started with the middle number first Middle number is found by taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two | . | Binary Search can be represented using a tree as shown below | . . Heres an easy way to put it: . binary search fidns the desired element by continuously chopping the search area in half | say the element you are looking for is &#39;f&#39; | . [a b c d e f g h] . We would start in the middle at element &#39;d&#39; | becuase our target is greater than d we will eliminate everything left of &#39;d&#39; including &#39;d&#39; (chopping it in half) . [e f g h] is what now remains . again we would &#39;chop in half&#39; | say we iterate through &#39;g&#39; and &#39;h&#39;, our desired element is still not found so we would eliminate &#39;g; and &#39;h&#39; and continue the process | . [e f] . now we are down to 2 elements | &#39;chopping in half&#39; will give us our desired element | . [f] . | . def BinarySearch(array, x, low, high): # Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each other while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low)//2 # find the middle (taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two) if array[mid] == x: # if desired number is the middle is found return desired number (middle number) return mid elif array[mid] &lt; x: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 return -1 array = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] x = 4 result = BinarySearch(array, x, 0, len(array)-1) if result != -1: print(&quot;Element is present at index &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not found&quot;) . Element is present at index 1 . We have created a function called binary_search() function which takes two arguments - a list to be sorted and a number to be searched. . | We have declared two variables to store the lowest and highest values in the list. The lowest is assigned initial value to 0, the highest to len(list1) 1 and mid as 0. . | Next, we have declared the while loop with the condition that the lowest is equal and smaller than the highest. The while loop will iterate if the number has not been found yet. . | In the while loop, we find the mid value and compare the index value to the number we are searching for. . | If the value of the mid-index is smaller than n, we increase the mid value by 1 and assign it to the low. The search moves to the left side. . | Otherwise, if the value of mid index is larger than n, we decrease the mid value by 1 and assign it to the high. The search moves to the right side. . | If the n is equal to the mid value then return mid. . | This will happen until the low is equal and smaller than the high. . | If we reach at the end of the function, then the element is not present in the list. We return -1 to the calling function. . | . . Hacks . Using my example above and steps below, create your own iteration using binary search . Steps . Compare x with the middle element. | If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index. | Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half. | Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half. | . def BinarySearcher(sortedlist, x): beginning = 0 mid = 0 end = len(sortedlist)-1 while beginning &lt;= end: mid = (beginning+end)//2 if sortedlist[mid] == x: return mid elif sortedlist[mid] &gt; x: end = mid - 1 else: beginning = mid + 1 return -1 x = int(input(&quot;Integer to search through&quot;)) sortedlist = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20] result = BinarySearcher(sortedlist,x) if result != -1: print(&quot;Element is present at index &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not found&quot;) . Element is present at index 18 . Homework Assignment (DUE FRIDAY 12/09 BY 5:00 PM) . Consider this situation: . You&#39;re playing a short game using a random number generator from 1 to 20 .

Lists are just one of four collection data types in Python . Tuple: collection that is ordered, unchangeable, allows duplicates | Set: collection that is unordered, unchangeable, doesn&#39;t allow duplicates | Dictionary: collection that is ordered, changeable, doesn&#39;t allow duplicates | . Terms . Index: a term used to sort data in order to reference to an element in a list (allows for duplicates) | Elements: the values in the list assigned to an index | . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;grape&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;] index = 1 print (fruits[index]) . Methods in Lists . Method Definition Example . append() | adds element to the end of the list | fruits.append(&quot;watermelon&quot;) | . index() | returns the index of the first element with the specified value | fruits.index(&quot;apple&quot;) | . insert() | adds element at given position | fruits.insert(1, &quot;watermelon&quot;) | . remove() | removes the first item with the specified value | fruits.remove(&quot;strawberry&quot;) | . reverse() | reverses the list order | fruits.reverse() | . sort() | sorts the list | fruits.sort() | . count() | returns the amount of elements with the specified value | fruits.count(&quot;apple&quot;) | . copy() | returns a copy of the list | fruits.copy() | . clear() | removes the elements from the list | fruits.clear() | . sports = [&quot;football&quot;, &quot;soccer&quot;, &quot;baseball&quot;, &quot;basketball&quot;] # change the value &quot;soccer&quot; to &quot;hockey&quot; sports.remove(&quot;soccer&quot;) sports.insert(1, &quot;hockey&quot;) print (sports) .

Coding all of these individually takes a lot of unnecessary time, how can we shorten this time? . Iteration . Iteration is the repetition of a process or utterance applied to the result or taken from a previous statement. There&#39;s a lot of types of iteration though, what to use? How do we apply iteration to lists? . Some methods include using a &quot;for loop&quot;, using a &quot;for loop and range()&quot;, using a &quot;while loop&quot;, and using comprehension . Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are iterable objects. They are the &#39;containers&#39; that store the data to iterate. . Each of these containers are able to iterate with the iter() command. . There are 2 types of iteration:definite and indefinite. Definite iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met . for variable in iterable: statement() . Iterator? Iterable? Iteration? . When an object is iterable it can be used in an iteration | When passed through the function iter() it returns an iterator | Strings, lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples are all examples of iterable objects. | . a = [&#39;alpha&#39;, &#39;bravo&#39;, &#39;charlie&#39;] itr = iter(a) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) . alpha bravo charlie .

A 2D array is simply just a list of lists. The example below is technically correct but... . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Conventially 2D arrays are written like below. This is because 2D arrays are meant to be read in 2 dimensions (hence the name). Writing them like below makes them easier to visualize and understand. . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Printing a 2D Array . We already know that we can&#39;t just print the matrix by calling it. We need to iterate through it to print it. . def print_matrix1(matrix): for i in range(len(matrix)): # outer for loop. This runs on i which represents the row. range(len(matrix)) is in order to iterate through the length of the matrix for j in range(len(matrix[i])): # inner for loop. This runs on the length of the i&#39;th row in the matrix (j changes for each row with a different length) print(matrix[i][j], end=&quot; &quot;) # [i][j] is the 2D location of that value in the matrix, kinda like a coordinate pair. [i] iterates to the specific row and [j] iterates to the specific value in the row. end=&quot; &quot; changes the end value to space, not a new line. print() # prints extra line. this is in the outer loop, not the inner loop, because it only wants to print a new line for each row . print(&quot;Raw matrix (list of lists): &quot;) print(keypad) print(&quot;Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration:&quot;) print_matrix1(keypad) print() . Raw matrix (list of lists): [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&#39; &#39;, 0, &#39; &#39;]] Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . def print_matrix2(matrix): for row in matrix: # Iterates through each &quot;row&quot; of matrix. Row is a dummy variable, it could technically be anything. It iterates through each value of matrix and each value is it&#39;s own list. in this syntax the list is stored in &quot;row&quot;. for col in row: # Iterates through each value in row. Again col, column, is a dummy variable. Each value in row is stored in col. print(col, end=&quot; &quot;) # Same as 1 print() # Same as 1 print_matrix2(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . More Functions . Try to find another way to print the matrix. Only complete one of the two (unless you&#39;d like to do both). Below is a hint . fruit = [&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;bananas&quot;, &quot;grapes&quot;] print(fruit) print(*fruit) # Python built in function: &quot;*&quot;. Figure out what it does . [&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;bananas&#39;, &#39;grapes&#39;] apples bananas grapes . def print_matrix3(matrix): code = &quot;your code goes here&quot; # Don&#39;t have to do one . Alternatively, find a way to print the matrix using the iter() function you already learned. Or use both! . Homework . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] def print_matrix4(keypad): iterations = iter(keypad) while True: try: row = next(iterations) for column in row: print(column, end = &quot; &quot;) print() except StopIteration: break print_matrix4(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . Print what month you were born and how old you are by iterating through the keyboard (don&#39;t just write a string). . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] def printer(keyboard): rsp = input(&quot;Month: &quot;) rsp2 = input(&quot;Age: &quot;) solve_rsp = &quot;&quot; + str(rsp.upper().strip()) solve_rsp2 = &quot;&quot; + str(rsp2).strip().upper() for letter in solve_rsp: if any(letter in row for row in keyboard): print(letter) for row in keyboard: if letter in row == False: row[row.index(letter)] = &quot; &quot; for letter in solve_rsp2: if any(letter in row for row in keyboard): print(letter) for row in keyboard: if letter in row == False: row[row.index(letter)] = &quot; &quot; printer(keyboard) . D E C E M B E R 1 6 . Challenge also homework . Change all of the letters that you DIDN&#39;T print above to spaces, &quot; &quot;, and then print the full keyboard. (the things you did print should remain in the same spot) . Alternative Challenge: If you would prefer, animate it using some form of delay so it flashes one of your letters at a time on the board in order and repeats. (this one may be slightly more intuitive) . DO NOT HARD CODE THIS. Don&#39;t make it harder on yourself, iterate through, make it abstract so it can be used dynamically. You should be able to input any string and your code should work. . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] def printer(keyboard): rsp = input(&quot;Month: &quot;) rsp2 = input(&quot;Age: &quot;) solve_rsp = &quot;&quot; + str(rsp.upper().strip()) solve_rsp2 = &quot;&quot; + str(rsp2).strip().upper() for letter in solve_rsp: if any(letter in row for row in keyboard): # print(letter) for row in keyboard: if letter in row: row[row.index(letter)] = &quot; &quot; for letter in solve_rsp2: if any(letter in row for row in keyboard): # print(letter) for row in keyboard: if letter in row: row[row.index(letter)] = &quot; &quot; for row in keyboard: print(&quot; &quot;.join(row)) printer(keyboard) . ` 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 0 - = Q W T Y U I O P [ ] A S F G H J K L ; &#39; Z X V N , . / .

            "content": "Lesson Overview: 3.5 - Boolean Expressions . Here we will focus on: basics of Booleans | its relationship with binary | relational operators | Logical Operators | . | . What is a boolean? . A data type with two possible values: true or false | . Boolean and Binary . So similar yet so different. . Boolean math and binary notation both use the same two ciphers: 1 and 0. | However, please note that Boolean quantities are restricted to a singlular bit (can only be either 1, or 0) | On the otherhand, binary numbers may be composed of many bits adding up in place-weighted form to any finite value, or size | . Must Knows . A Boolean value is either TRUE or FALSE | The AP Exam will provide you with a reference sheet with the operators below. | . A few ways these operators could be used... | . Relational Operators in action . How could you use operators to determine if the average of 5 grades is greater than 80? | . With the grades below, use a boolean expression to determine if the average grade is above an 80 and print the result (True or False) | Try it in as few steps as possible! | Be creative! There are obviously TONS of different practical solutions | . grade1 = 90 grade2 = 65 grade3 = 60 grade4 = 75 grade5 = 95 grades = grade1 + grade2 + grade3 + grade4 + grade5 average = grades % 5 average &gt; 80 if average == 0: print(&quot;false&quot;) else: print(&quot;true&quot;) . false . The versatility of relational operators: . print(&quot;100 == 100:&quot;,100==100) print(&quot;Hello == Adios:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;==&quot;farewell&quot;) print(&quot;Hello != Adios:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;!=&quot;farewell&quot;) print(&quot;Hello == Hola:&quot;,&quot;greeting&quot;==&quot;greeting&quot;) print(&quot;5&gt;=4:&quot;, 5&gt;=4) print (&#39;&#39;) # Notice that relational operators can even work on lists! # For lists, the relational operator compares each respective component until an answer is derived print(&quot;[&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;] &gt; [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;]:&quot;, [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;] &gt; [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] &gt; [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] &gt; [1,2,3,4]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] &lt; [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] &lt; [1,2,3,4]) print(&quot;[1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]:&quot;, [1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]) . 100 == 100: True Hello == Adios: False Hello != Adios: True Hello == Hola: True 5&gt;=4: True [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;] &gt; [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z&#39;]: False [1,2,3,5] &gt; [1,2,3,4]: True [1,2,3,5] &lt; [1,2,3,4]: False [1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]: False . Logical Operators! . These types of operators don&#39;t necessarily deal with equivalent/non-equivalent values, but they rather work on operands to produce a singular boolean result . AND : returns TRUE if the operands around it are TRUE | OR : returns TRUE if at least one operand is TRUE | NOT : returns TRUE if the following boolean is FALSE | . Turn the following arithmetic phrases into either True or False statements as indicated USING LOGICAL OPERATORS . print(&quot;1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12:&quot;, 1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12) # Output TRUE using OR ^ # Output FALSE using NOT print(&quot;24 &gt; 8:&quot;, not 24 &gt; 8) # Output FALSE using AND print(&quot;10 &gt; 20:&quot;, 10 &gt; 20 and False) . 1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12: True 24 &gt; 8: False 10 &gt; 20: False . Lesson Overview: 3.6 - Conditionals . Focusing on Selection . Selection: uses a condition that evaluates to true or false . Selection determines which part of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false . Algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task . Conditional Statements . Also known as &quot;if statements&quot; . Can be seen as if statements or if blocks . Can also be seen as if else statements or if else-blocks . x = 20 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) . x is greater than y . x = 20 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is not greater than y&quot;) . x is greater than y . Participation . -Calculate the total sum of two numbers, if it is equal to 200, print 200, if otherwise, print the sum. . num1 = 200 num2 = 200 sum = num1 + num2 print(str(sum) + &quot;You don&#39;t need a condtional for this&quot; ) . 400 . Lesson Overview - 3.7 Nested Conditionals . Nested conditional statements consist of conditional statements within other conditional statements | Utilizes &quot;if else&quot; statements within &quot;if else&quot; statements | . Basics of a nested conditional: | . Block Coding Visual of Nested Conditionals: | Example Psuedocode of Nested Conditional Statements | . Analyzing Code Walkthrough . Psuedocode to the left, block code to the right | Approach the problem by going through each condition one at a time . Decide which ones are false to skip and which ones are true to execute | . | You Try: . | . Psuedocode: Lives would print 4 as the result of the and &amp; or is false it would print 4 as it is the result of 4 - 1 which is the value for lives . score = 82 if (score &gt;= 90) { console.log(&quot;You got an A, congrats!&quot;) } else { if (score &gt;= 75) { console.log(&quot;Please come to retake up to a 90 next week at tutorial!&quot;) } else { console.log(&quot;You have detention!&quot;) } } .

However in the concatenation the order for problem 1 was different and the spacing for 2 as well due to the concatenation. Very good job on warm up due to your comments you get a bonus making up for some mistakes. | 1/1 | . Soham | 0.5/0.5 | This is a pretty solid flowchart overall :) You have most of the steps correct. All you’re missing is the “stop” step at the end and you were meant to add the “sum = 0” and “count = 0” as a step in the actual flowchart instead of as a sticky to the side, same goes for the “if count &lt; 6” step. | 0.5/0.5 . One of your questions was incorrect, but we gave you a bonus for showing your work . | Very good on your conversion along with predictions for your warm up hacks however there was no prediction made for the string problems in psuedocode there will be no access to a computer during the ap exam so practice needs to be maintained for these skills | 1/1 | .

One mistake I saw was that you forgot to add vote1 and vote2 into str() in line 7 of your code for problem 2, which is necessary to turn the the contents of the variable votes into strings so that you can print them through string concatentation. There were also no predictions good job on warm up problems. | 0.8/0.5 | . Shreya | 0.5/0.5 | This is also very neat and well organized! Some things that can be fixed are that the “start” step should be in a oval, the “sum = 0 and count = 0” should be in a rectangle, the “sum + n = sum” and “count = count + 1” should be combined into one step, and add the “stop” step at the end.

I had mistakenly used the value for after the function had executed getting 6, I had not taken into acount the sum of the value of all the integers between 0-5 which would set the value. The major reason for this issue was misunderstanding the question and not finding the value for result which was what the question had asked for. The best way to solve this issue would be to re-read the problem and to pay attention to all aspects not just what would be the first answer that would come to mind when looking at the problem. . . When solving the problem I had not taken into account that the &gt; while excluding 0 in the first portion of the conditional statement, however the else condition would be applicable to 0 making the value for count2 to not be 2 but 3 indicated in the correct answer.

Throughout this Trimester many groups of students have worked hard to display the full course of their understading via there Night at the Museum Project, however, we as group throughout the development process may have focused on our project, we gained the ability to reflect based on the outstanding work that many groups have down also showcasing their learning. These are my personal notes on the that they presented at Night at the Museum. . Api Notes . Alan, Steven, Ederick, Noor, Liav - calendar that shows date and weather, can put in an event on any day and it saves, can search for any city weather . Luke - Has a variety of quizzes to choose from to use them to generate random questions, geography, math, and sat questions. About pages linkes to eveyone fastpages. . Paaras, Samarth, AJ, Haoxuan - An api that grabs some of the best of best motivational qoutes from the internet, and allows users to vote on the quality of the votes through hosting a number counter. Also are able to pulled to get a random qoutes. . Peacock Justin, James, Shruti, Joslyn - recreation of the classic game tetris, and through the use of astronomy api to create table based on the city name and gives location details longitude latitude and moon traits. . Advay, Krishiv, Shivansh, Dhruva, Prasith - Motivational qputes api to curate qoutes accross the internet, and heleaps pepple calculate goals and calories, BMI calculator, and fitness goals. . Jonathan, Martin, Abdulla, Leonard - Basketball stats of each NBA team, used an api to get the stats fpr each team and through thier website made it accesable to the user with ease. . Lyntax Aniket, Soham, Ryan, Lucas - One api with a dictionary hosted on a flask server that has words and definitions so users can imput it against a word. Which serves to play a hangman game. Which also eliminates letters and dynamically renders the charector. . Ananya, Sreeja, Aliya, Clair - Wordle game that uses thier custom api that imports and uses it randomly uses it to generate a game. Also checks if words are valid are not and informs the user if they are incorrect or not. . Raunak, Tanay, Yuri, Sachit, Harsha - Clock alarm and stopwatch, using a custom api to request data from a variety of time of timezones to display times. . Lily, Ekam, Ishi, Shreyas - Uses a custom dictionary api of different words and thier definitions to allow users to find them and a word of the day that changes. Along with a feedback to adapt the user experience. . Aiden ahad dash sabine - Innovative api that has games such as tetris, blackjack, cookie clicker, and a pokemon game with custom to log losses wins, correct answers wrong and other game data. . The fream team we make code with varalu azeem chubmag and colin, we made and acedemic organizer, with a custom api that fetches information predominantly wikipedia and stores the data to make an acedmic organizer . Devon, trent, drew, jager - Made custom api to conpare likes to dislikes to pull it as an alarm for a stopwatch is able to manage your workflow through several options, such as notifications, that can keep you on track, and set break intervals, and tasks . Keira, Zeen, Ellie, Giannina - Made custom custmoer survey along with a quiz that has three different quizzes for calculus, physics, and satstics, with soultion with randomized questions from a database. Along with a quiz summary and a customer service api that prompts users woth questions saving them to a data base. Along with an explanation to show how the problems you missed could be solved. . Reflections . In my opinion this showcases the vast strides many students inclusing myself have made this trimester, with coming from barely understanding any CS concepts prior to this class have been able to grow and develop to make a large variety of projects based apon their understanding of APIs, CSS, HTML, Fastpages, and Python. From creating projcts like ours via games, from Pokemon, Tetris, to other educational tools like quizzes on wide variety of topics or other tools like health trackers, and calanders everyone showcased an amount of growth one may not think possible in just one trimester. .",

            "title": "Tirth Thakkar Measurements And Graphical Analysis Lab",
            "content": "Procedure: All 5 disks will be labeled, then have thier radius measured using a meter stick, after which they will be weighed on a digtal scale to collect data regarding their mass. Then their thickness was measured by using a meter stick. After the data regarding the radius and mass was put into a table, which was used to create graph 1 through sheets. After which the graph was linearlized by using r2 as the x value as it is the only value that isn’t constant to create graph2 after imputing it into sheets and creating a graph. . Purpose Statement: . Given “disks” of different radii, determine the relationship between the mass and radius of the disks through graphical method. . In using graphical method, we will learn about linearization and the use of it to create a mathematical model. . Equations: . p=m/v . | m=p*v . | V=a*h . | m=p*a*h . | m=p*pi*r^2*h . | Data Table: .   Height Radius (cm) Mass(g)   Radius^2 (cm^2) . Disk 1 | 0.14 mm | 2.38 | 0.08 |   | 5.66 | . Disk 2 |   | 3.15 | 0.14 |   | 9.92 | . Disk 3 |   | 3.80 | 0.24 |   | 14.44 | . Disk 4 |   | 5.40 | 0.38 |   | 29.16 | . Disk 5 |   | 6.85 | 0.71 |   | 46.92 | . Graph 1 . Graph 2 . . y = 0.0148x - 3.1*10-3 . Analysis Questions: . 1) What is the independent variable in your y = mx +b formula? The independent variable on the formula would be r2 it is the only constant variable across all the formulas. . As the density is equal to ⍴ = m/v and as density is constant m can be m = ⍴v, and as v = a*h, and expanded it would be v = π*r2*h, so when substituted into the equation for mass m = ⍴*π*r2*h, and as all three values density (all discs are aluminum), π (constant), h (all are the same thickness) are constant it would make r2 the only value that changes between all 5 discs making it the independent variable. . -——————————————————————————————————————– . 2) What does the slope represent in your y = mx +b formula? Show dimensionally that indeed that is what your slope represents and that the formula is valid dimensionally. . The slope represents ⍴πh. As the equation for density is ⍴ = m/v and as ⍴ is constant it allows for m = πv, which allows for it to be rewritten as m = ⍴*π*h*r2 and as m is the y value and r2 is the x value it can be further rewritten as y = ⍴*π*h*x making ⍴πh the slope. And the formula is m = ⍴*π*h*r2 is demensionally valid as . m = (m(πr2h)-1)(h)(r2) which is M = (M(L2L)-1)(L)(L2), M = M (L-3)(L3), M = M . -——————————————————————————————————————– . 3) Should the “b” in your y = mx + b formula be zero? Explain your answer. . Yes as the independent variable is r2 and as a disc with the radius of 0 should also have a mass of 0 (dependent variable). . -——————————————————————————————————————– . 4) Measure/estimate the “thickness” of your cylinders. Use that value to find the experimental density of your cylinders. Find a percent difference between your found density and the actual density. The actual material is aluminum. . The thickness value of the cylinders was 0.14 mm (0.014 cm), with a slope of 0.0148 (⍴*π*h), ⍴ = 0.0148/π*(0.014 cm), ⍴ = 0.336 g/cm3, compared to the real density of aluminum which is 2.3/cm3. | 0.336-2.3 | /2.3 *100, 85.39% error. | . -——————————————————————————————————————– . 5) errors. Make sure you explain why your number is bigger or smaller than (if positive or negative difference.) . My number is substantially smaller as when using the line of best fit the value for the y-intercept is not 0 i.e. when r2 = 0 the value for mass is not 0 which is not possible in real life meaning that that decrepency coupled with the fact that the measuring techniques through using a meter stick to estimate the thickness and radius of the disks would also be less accurate than proper electronic measurements in a lab. . -——————————————————————————————————————– . Synthesis Questions: . 1) In this experiment, if we had used disks with a greater thickness, would the slope . of your best fit line have been different? Would your experimental value for density be . the same? Explain. . If disks of greater thickness was used the value for slope would be different as previously mentioned when the expanded equation for mass which is m = ⍴*π*h*r2 . is rewritten would be y = ⍴*π*h(x), and which would make ⍴*π*h the slope and as h is a part of the slope value and if it were greater it would make the slope greater. However, the density would stay the same as the material would remain unchanged as if the height was greater it would also cause the mass to increase and it would cancel out when solving for the density. . -——————————————————————————————————————– . 2) How would your graph of m versus r2 be different if you had used disks of the same . thickness, but made out of steel? Draw a second line on your m versus r2 plot that . represents disks made of steel. . If you had used disks made of steel but of the same thickness, you would have disks of a greater density than that of the aluminum graph. Which would cause the graph mass vs r2 to be above that of the one made of aluminum. . . -——————————————————————————————————————– . 3) Another group of students has acquired data for the exact same experiment; . however, their disks are made of an unknown material that they are trying to . determine. The group’s m versus r2 data produced a line of best fit with slope equal to . 122 kg/m2. Each disk they measured had the same 0.5 cm thickness. Calculate the . density of the unknown material and use the table below to help determine what . material their disks are made of. . m = ⍴*π*h*r2, y = ⍴*π*h(x), 122kg/m2 = ⍴*π*0.005, 122/0.005π = ⍴, ⍴ = 7,766.76 kg/m3, 7,766.761kg/m3 * 1000g/kg = 7,766,761g/m3 * 1*106 cm3/m3 = 7,766,761g/1*106, 7.766761g/cm3 approx 7.8 = Iron . -——————————————————————————————————————– . Multiple Choice: . 1) &gt; - E . 1. &gt; m = ⍴ *π *h *r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, C = 2πr, C/2π = r, m = ⍴ *π *h *(C/2π)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, m = ⍴ *π *h *C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4π&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ⍴ *h *C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4π, ⍴h/4π(x), . 2) &gt; - C . 1. &gt; ⍴ = m/v and as density is constant m can be m = ⍴v, and as v = 4/3πr&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, so when substituted into the equation for mass m = ⍴ *π *4/3πr&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and the only non constant is r&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; making it the only value that would lineralize the graph .
