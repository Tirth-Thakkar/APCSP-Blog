    "- The name of the list is called leaders which stores 5 Leader objects. The code snippet above shows the use of a for loop to iterate through the list and follow through the create method in the Leader class which adds the Leader to the Leaderboard SQL table. Which contributes the greater functionality of the program this allows for the creation of a database with data which is then used later in the program through the use of SQL alchemy functions to be able to sort the data in the database and thus generate the filtered leaderboard and be accessed via a get request. Along with the user of other functions such as endpoints to be able to access all the scores of a selected Leader via post request specifying the desired Leader. "
