    "- The video demonstrates the adding of a score to the scoreboard and then ordering the score to its corresponding location after creating the leader, only if the score is greater than 0. \n",

    "- The inputs and outputs of this program are the following:\n",
    "    - Inputs: \n",
    "        - The user's name\n",
    "        - The user's score\n",
    "    - Outputs:\n",
    "        - Success message indicating creation or telling the user score is 0\n",
    "        - The user's score's location being sorted on the scoreboard \n",
    "    - These metrics prevent the leaderboard from being cluttered with scores that are 0 and creates the corresponding score table for the games that have been played. \n",
