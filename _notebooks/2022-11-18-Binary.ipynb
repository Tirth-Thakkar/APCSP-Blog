    "- Abstraction hiding aspects of a program to make it more user friendly\n",
    "- Octal, Hexadecimal, decimal, binary, etc., talking about the number of symbols per digit\n",
    "- Have to approach things in a scientific manner - do research\n",
    "- Toggling binary digits of bits to represent different numbers \n",
    "- Does so through transistors that can get turned on and off in patterns can allow for a computer to count in patterns \n",
    "- Binary patterns came to be 20, 21, etc. similar to binary which is base 10\n",
    "- To count higher the number of bits increases, the highest number that can be stored in three bits is 7 and it can increase to store more, usually 8 bits\n",
    "- Letters can also be stored as different values allowing other functions to be possible with a computer \n"
