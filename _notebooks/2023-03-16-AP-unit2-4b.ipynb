    "## Notes\n",
    "- What is an abstraction?\n",
    "    - An abstraction is veiling something in order to make something simpler such as classes and functions. \n",
    "- What is SQL?\n",
    "    - SQL or Structured Query Language is a language used to communicate with databases. When using sql you are able to create, read, update, and delete data from a database. SQLAlchemy abstracts commands in SQL however as a result of this we cannot see the actual effects of what happens in SQL itself.\n",
    "- What are the datatypes in an SQL table?\n",
    "    - The datatype in an SQL table are: \n",
    "        - Integer: Integer is a data type that stores whole numbers.\n",
    "        - Real: Real is a data type that stores floating point numbers.\n",
    "        - Text: Text is a collection of characters stored as a single entity in a database management system.\n",
    "        - Blob: Binary Large Object (BLOB) is a collection of binary data stored as a single entity in a database management system.\n",
    "        - Null: A null value is a special value that indicates that a value is missing or unknown.\n",
    "- What is a connection object?\n",
    "    - A connection object is an object that is used to connect to a database. It is used to create a cursor object that is used to execute SQL statements.\n",
    "- What is a database schema? \n",
    "    - A database schema is a blueprint or a plan for the database. It defines how the data is organized and how the relations among them are associated. It also defines the constraints on the data, the functions and operations that can be applied to the data. \n",
    "- The most commonly used query in SQL is called select, they will look similar but the command in the middle will be different.   "
