    "- What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database?\n",
    "    - The Purpose of a primary key in SQL database is to uniquely identify each row in a table. A primary key must contain unique values, and cannot contain NULL values.\n",
    "- What are the Data Types in SQL table?\n",
    "    - The datatypes in an SQL table are: \n",
    "        - Integer: Integer is a data type that stores whole numbers.\n",
    "        - Real: Real is a data type that stores floating point numbers.\n",
    "        - Text: Text is a collection of characters stored as a single entity in a database management system.\n",
