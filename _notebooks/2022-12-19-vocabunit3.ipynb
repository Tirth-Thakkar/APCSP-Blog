    "## Variables\n",
    "- Category: Storing & Manipulating Data\n",
    "- Definition: A variable is a named location used to store data in the memory. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Its sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This allows for better organization of the data, and allows the data to be accessed and modified by a reference to an identifier. Variables can also be changed during a program's execution. Variables can be used for storing data of different types, such as numbers, strings, lists, etc. Variables are created when you assign a value to it. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables. The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable. \n",

    "## Data Types\n",
    "- Category: Storing & Manipulating Data\n",
    "- Definition: Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. Python has various data types that are used to define the operations possible on them and the storage method for each of them. The data type specifies the size and type of values that can be stored in the variable. The data type of a variable is the type of data that variable can store. For example, a variable of type int can only store integer values. The data type of a variable can be changed during the execution of a program. Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories: \n",
    "    - Text Type: str \n",
    "    - Numeric Types: int, float, complex \n",
    "    - Sequence Types: list, tuple, range \n",
    "    - Mapping Type: dict \n",
    "    - Set Types: set, frozenset \n",
    "    - Boolean Type: bool \n",
    "    - Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, and memoryview. \n",
    "- However more the most common data types are Integers, Floats, Strings, Booleans, and Lists/Arrays. `In some programming languages like C, C++, and Java, the data types are explicitly declared. In Python, the data type is automatically inferred from the value assigned to the variable.`\n",

The assignment operator (=) is used to assign values to variables. The value of the right-hand side of the expression is calculated first and then assigned to the variable on the left-hand side. The assignment operator can also be used to assign the result of any expression to a variable. Other assignment operators in python also include +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=, &=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<=, etc. Which are used for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, floor division, exponent, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, bitwise XOR, bitwise right shift, bitwise left shift, respectively.\n",

    "## Dictionaries\n",
    "- Category: Managing Complexity with Variables\n",
    "- Defintion: A dictionary stores (key, value) pairs, similar to a Map in Java or an object in Javascript. Dictionaries are optimized to retrieve values when the key is known. In Python, a dictionary is created by placing a sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by ‘comma’. Dictionary holds a pair of values, one being the Key and the other corresponding pair element being its Key:value. Values in a dictionary can be of any datatype and can be duplicated, whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be immutable. Dictionaries are optimized to retrieve values when the key is known. Python’s dictionaries are kind of hash table type. It consists of key-value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost any Python type, but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python object. This can be used to mangage complexity as through storing key and value pairs it can prevent the need for things like having a secondary list to store the values of a key. This can also be used to store data in a more organized manner as it can be used to store data in a way that is more easily accessible. For instance if you were to store a list of students and their grades you could use a dictionary to store the students name as the key and the grade as the value. This would allow you to easily access the grade of a student by simply using the students name as the key.\n",

There are four sequence types in Python: strings, lists, tuples, and range objects. Strings are immutable sequences of Unicode code points. Lists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of homogeneous items (where the precise degree of similarity will vary by application). Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data (such as the 2-tuples produced by the enumerate() built-in). Ranges are immutable sequences of numbers and are commonly used for looping a specific number of times in for loops.\n",

    "- Definition: Truth tables show the results of combining boolean values to show the whether or not a condition can be true or false. For instance if you were to make a truth table for the condition of a person being able to vote you could make it so that the first column would be the age of the person and the second column would be whether or not they are a citizen. Then you could make it so that if the person is 18 or older and a citizen they can vote, if they are 18 or older and not a citizen they can not vote, if they are under 18 and a citizen they can not vote, and if they are under 18 and not a citizen they can not vote. This is an illustration of how truth tables can be used to make decisions in a program. However they can also be used when expressing other operations besides *and* such as *or*, *not*, and *xor*.\n",
