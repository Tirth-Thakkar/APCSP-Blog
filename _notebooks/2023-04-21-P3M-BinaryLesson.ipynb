    "\n",
    "#### Basic Information\n",
    "* Bit is short for `binary` digit, and represents a value of either 0 or 1.\n",
    "    - A byte is 8 bits.\n",
    "* Sequences of bits are used to represent different things.\n",
    "    - Representing data with sequences of bits is called `binary sequence`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practice Questions:\n",
    "1. How many bits are in 3 bytes?\n",
    "    - `8*3 = 24 bits`  \n",
    "2. What digital information can be represented by bits? \n",
    "    - `All digital information can be represented by bits` \n",
    "3. Are bits an analog or digital form of storing data? What is the difference between the two?\n",
    "    - `Bits are a digital form of storing data the difference between the two is that digital is represented in bits as a 1 or 0 however with analog data it has the possibility of having other values.` \n",
    "#### Examples\n",

    "#### Basic Information\n",
    "* Binary is Base 2, meaning each digit can only represent values of 0 and 1.\n",
    "* Decimal is Base 10, meaning each digit can represent values from 0 to 9.\n",
    "* Conversion between sequences of binary to decimal depend on how many binary numbers there are, their values and their positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practice Questions:\n",
    "1. What values can each digit of a Base 5 system represent?\n",
    "    - `The value a 5 digit based system can represent is 5^n depending on where it correlates to then the prior values can be added to each other to be able to get the total value of the number as for instance 001001 can be represent as (0 x 2^6) + (0 x 2^6) + (1 x 2^5) ... and how a similar concept can be used in a base 10 system we could do the exact same thing with a base 5 system.` \n",

    "2. What base is Hexadecimal? What range of values can each digit of Hexadecimal represent?\n",

    "\n",
    "3. When using a base above 10, letters can be used to represent numbers past 9. These letters start from A and continue onwards. For example, the decimal number 10 is represented by the letter A in Hexadecimal. What letter would be used to represent the Base 10 number 23 in a Base 30 system? What about in a Base 50 system?\n",
    "- `In a base system above 10, letters are used to represent numbers past 9. To find the letter that represents a particular number in a given base system, we perform integer division and modulus operations. For example, to represent the number 23 in a base 30 system, we divide 23 by 30 and take the remainder, which is 23. The corresponding letter for the number 23 in base 30 is H, so 23 in base 30 is represented as the single digit H. Similarly, to represent the number 23 in a base 50 system, we divide 23 by 50 and take the remainder, which is 23. The corresponding letter for the number 23 in base 50 is X, so 23 in base 50 is represented as the single digit X.`\n",
