    "- Make a quiz that also shows incorrect answers that functions in the same way as the current implementation in a way that is not affected by prior runs. \n",
    "- Add images that are interactive and can be manipulated for easter eggs or questions. \n",
    "- Add a system that shows a live score for incorrect and correct questions answered as they progress along the quiz. \n",
