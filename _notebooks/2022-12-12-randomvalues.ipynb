    "# Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "* A library is a collection of precompiled codes that can be used later on in a program for some specific well-defined operations. \n",
    "* These precompiled codes can be referred to as modules. Each module contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs.\n",
    "* A library may also contain documentation, configuration data, message templates, classes, and values, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are libraries important?\n",
    "* Using Libraries makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. \n",
    "* One example would be through looping and iteration, as we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. \n",
    "* Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A few libraries that simplify coding processes:\n",
    "* **Pillow** allows you to work with images.\n",
    "* **Tensor Flow** helps with data automation and monitors performance.\n",
    "* **Matplotlib** allows you to make 2D graphs and plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AP Exam Refrence Sheet itself is a library!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hacks:\n",
    "Research two other Python Libraries NOT DISCUSSED DURING LESSON and make a markdown post, explaining their function and how it helps programmers code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### API’s\n",
    "* An Application Program Interface, or API, contains specific direction for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. \n",
    "* An API acts as a gateway for the imported procedures from a library to interact with the rest of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activity: Walkthrough with NumPy\n",
    "* Install NumPy on VSCode:\n",
    "    1. Open New Terminal In VSCode:\n",
    "    2. pip3 install --upgrade pip\n",
    "    3. pip install numpy \n",

    "- requests: Allows you to send HTTP requests to web servers and get responses back. Has built in functions for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. (the most common HTTP requests). Highly customizable allowing you to set headers, cookies, and other parameters. Which allows the module to be used for a wide variety of tasks such as web scraping, web automation, and API testing.\n",

    "- emoji: Allows you to use emojis in your code. This is useful for when you want to add emojis to your code. Also allows you to convert emojis to text and text to emojis. Along with mutliple functions for working with emojis. An example of this would be the ability to get a list of all emojis or other emoji related antics. "
