    "After changing to an unsupported theme from Jekyl, there seems to be a lack of options to toggle to tags and other features present to allow switching between pages. There also seems to be a difference in the formatting of images as the appear to be no longer the similar size. Along with further issues with titles not being correctly spaced and ordered in a way that correlated well with their title-card images. Along with the favicon being missing as well, however all other functions such as the post appear to be functioning.  \n"
