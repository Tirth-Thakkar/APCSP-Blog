For example, a 32-bit computer uses 32 bits to represent an unsigned integer. So an unsigned integer can only be used in situations where the number used cannot be negative so in senarios like a shopping list where the number of groceries you need to buy cannot be negative. The advantages to using an unsigned integer is that it is faster to compute than a signed integer and it is easier to store in memory. The disadvantages are that it can only be used in situations where the number cannot be negative and it can only represent positive numbers making it prone to overflow errors if the number is implemented incorrectly in situation where there can be negative numbers such as a subtraction problem.\n",
