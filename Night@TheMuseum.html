<p>In my opinion this showcases the vast strides many students inclusing myself have made this trimester, with coming from barely understanding any CS concepts prior to this class have been able to grow and develop to make a large variety of projects based apon their understanding of APIs, CSS, HTML, Fastpages, and Python. From creating projcts like ours via games, from Pokemon, Tetris, to other educational tools like quizzes on wide variety of topics or other tools like health trackers, and calanders everyone showcased an amount of growth one may not think possible in <strong>just one trimester</strong>.</p>
