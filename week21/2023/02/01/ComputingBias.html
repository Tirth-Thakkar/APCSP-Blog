    <p>The information illustrates that mostly younger audiences are on TikTok with older audiences on Facebook. There is no purposeful exclusion but comes from the nature of the app but their content creates a divide that makes it so that certain audiences may begin to prefer slower paced vs faster paced content.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#female-voices" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Female Voices?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Virtual Assistants occupy roles that traditionally fill the roles of what is regarded as female jobs. Along with more data being present regarding women and the fact that female voices are easier to hear and are easier to annunciate.</li>

<a class="anchor" href="#is-this-purposeful" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Is this purposeful?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Yes, however it appears to be combination of multiple factors such as bias towards who should fill these roles. Along with the aspect of their being greater data regarding female voices and that they are clearer to hear and annunciate better than male voices making them better for those how may have hearing disabilities.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>No, the owner doesn’t seem to assume the computer is racist as seen in his tone and approach to manner. When he declares that the computer is racist he seems to be joking and not serious.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Through the lack of adequate data in the creation of this feature and thus the image recognition software was poorly able to handle anything expect those of a European decent.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Yes, as these biases create systems that are not able to handle a diverse group of users that may be using the system. These unjust systems may cause greater issues such as unjust convictions or other extensions of the system that may cause extreme harm to the users of system.</li>
            </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Our Personal systems may be improved by using crowd sourcing as we may be able to create systems that have greater security and error handling by allowing users to able to support and create our systems. We could also use crowd-sourcing to create new features that we may never have though of.</li>
