<td>This is pretty good for only one person working on it! Contains most of the key aspects of the flowchart. Iteration is correctly labeled (extra). But the steps are written in sentences instead of being written in symbols. Also, the “sum = 0” should be in a rectangle because it’s a process. You also should have set “count = 0,” but everything else looks good.</td>
<td>0.3/0.5</td>
<td>Good job on warm up hacks however the answers for the string concatenation problem were very incorrect you had numbers instead of flavors and an error in your other problem in regards to order printing. I would look at the posted solution and revise. Also no pseudocode predictions were made and result was not evaluated.</td>

<td>The knowledge of string operators/methods was very well executed in the code through knowing how to convert collegeboard into python. There was an issue with one line of your code however it should print “choclate vote 225 rasin vote 4” you had gotten the votes switched up. However, the value for the problems was not displayed properly before the code as part of the assignment was being able to solve the way you could on the ap exam which would not allow running of code. Overall good execution as the other assignments had the correct results.</td>
