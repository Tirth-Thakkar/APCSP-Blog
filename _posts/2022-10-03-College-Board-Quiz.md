<li>Had the main issues with understand the program purpose assignment and the problems with understand the question mostly stemming from the misunderstanding or misreading of the problem mostly when the entire question wasn't read multiple times due to aforementioned issues with understanding the college board Pseudocode </li>
<li>I also struggled with interpreting the questions in Program Design and Developments due to the strange wording present within the problems.   </li>
