**<span class="underline">Procedure:</span>** All 5 disks will be labeled, then have thier radius measured using a meter stick, after which they will be weighed on a digtal scale to collect data regarding their mass. Then their thickness was measured by using a meter stick. After the data regarding the radius and mass was put into a table, which was used to create graph 1 through sheets. After which the graph was linearlized by using r<sup>2</sup> as the x value as it is the only value that isn’t constant to create graph2 after imputing it into sheets and creating a graph.

**<span class="underline">Purpose Statement:</span>**

> Given “disks” of different radii, determine the relationship between the mass and radius of the disks through graphical method.
> 
> In using graphical method, we will learn about linearization and the use of it to create a mathematical model.

**<span class="underline">Equations:</span>**

1.  > p=m/v

2.  > m=p\*v

3.  > V=a\*h

4.  > m=p\*a\*h

5.  > m=p\*pi\*r^2\*h

> 
> As the density is equal to ⍴ = m/v and as density is constant m can be m = ⍴v, and as v = a\*h, and expanded it would be v = π\*r<sup>2</sup>\*h, so when substituted into the equation for mass m = ⍴\*π\*r<sup>2</sup>\*h, and as all three values density (all discs are aluminum), π (constant), h (all are the same thickness) are constant it would make r<sup>2</sup> the only value that changes between all 5 discs making it the independent variable.

> 
> The slope represents ⍴πh. As the equation for density is ⍴ = m/v and as ⍴ is constant it allows for m = πv, which allows for it to be rewritten as m = ⍴\*π\*h\*r<sup>2</sup> and as m is the y value and r<sup>2</sup> is the x value it can be further rewritten as y = ⍴\*π\*h\*x making ⍴πh the slope. And the formula is m = ⍴\*π\*h\*r<sup>2</sup> is demensionally valid as
> 
> m = (m(πr<sup>2</sup>h)<sup>-1</sup>)(h)(r<sup>2</sup>) which is M = (M(L<sup>2</sup>L)<sup>-1</sup>)(L)(L<sup>2</sup>), M = M (L<sup>-3</sup>)(L<sup>3</sup>), M = M

> **3)** Should the "b" in your y = mx + b formula be zero? Explain your answer.
> 
> Yes as the independent variable is r<sup>2</sup> and as a disc with the radius of 0 should also have a mass of 0 (dependent variable).

> **4)** Measure/estimate the "thickness" of your cylinders. Use that value to find the experimental density of your cylinders. Find a percent difference between your found density and the actual density. The actual material is aluminum.

> The thickness value of the cylinders was 0.14 mm (0.014 cm), with a slope of 0.0148 (⍴\*π\*h), ⍴ = 0.0148/π\*(0.014 cm), ⍴ = 0.336 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, compared to the real density of aluminum which is 2.3/cm<sup>3</sup>. |0.336-2.3|/2.3 \*100, 85.39% error.

> 
> My number is substantially smaller as when using the line of best fit the value for the y-intercept is not 0 i.e. when r<sup>2</sup> = 0 the value for mass is not 0 which is not possible in real life meaning that that decrepency coupled with the fact that the measuring techniques through using a meter stick to estimate the thickness and radius of the disks would also be less accurate than proper electronic measurements in a lab.

However, the density would stay the same as the material would remain unchanged as if the height was greater it would also cause the mass to increase and it would cancel out when solving for the density.
