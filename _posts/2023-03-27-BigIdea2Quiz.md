<ul>
<li>I had scored a score 25/25 or 100% on the quiz however there were still some questions that I had some difficulty with.</li>

<ul>
<li>The first question I had some difficulty with was problem one as binary values can be tricky at times however as I realized that as binary is base 2 I was able to plug in 2^value to be able to whittle down the options. </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://github.com/Tirth-Thakkar/APCSP-Blog/blob/master/images/BigIdeaQuestion25.png?raw=true" alt="Question2"></p>
<ul>
<li>Another question I had some difficulty with was question 25 as again I have difficulties with binary values as when remembering that binary is base 2 and 2^3 power is eight three more digits in binary would increase the value by a power of 8.</li>
