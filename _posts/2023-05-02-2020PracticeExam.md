<li>I incorrectly selected answer D when the the correct answer was option C as the algorithm doesn't work with the selected step as remainder needs to be decided and the quotient stored to properly make the program function this was a result of not being able to understand the calculations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Question-2">Question 2<a class="anchor-link" href="#Question-2"> </a></h2><ul>
<li><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108642800/235982612-2405749c-0726-43a1-aa59-159b60f5cc92.png" alt="image"></li>
<li>I incorrectly selected answer A when the correct answer was answer C as the selection would not allow the bot to move to the correct location but option C would allow the bot to be able to move the needed amount of spaces to the right location this was due to not properly evaluating the options. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Question-3">Question 3<a class="anchor-link" href="#Question-3"> </a></h2><ul>
<li><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108642800/235983899-6b453302-151d-41b6-912e-18d953cac4ed.png" alt="image"></li>
<li>I didn't know the nature of IPv6 addresses so I guessed a random choice in fact the correct answer is that the address is longer and thus allows for more connected devices on the internet thus the correct answer is option B</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Question-4">Question 4<a class="anchor-link" href="#Question-4"> </a></h2><ul>
<li><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108642800/235983339-3d565136-fcc4-4f79-85e0-7e3648f91620.png" alt="image"></li>
<li>I selected option C as through not understanding what a certificate authority does the correct answer is option D as the authority verifies encryption keys</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Question-5">Question 5<a class="anchor-link" href="#Question-5"> </a></h2><ul>
<li><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108642800/235984320-8f5d8a37-81e8-453f-8484-ce8b10341fe7.png" alt="image"></li>
<li>I incorrectly selected option B as the second answer when in fact it was option D, the selection of option A was correct the reason option B was incorrect was line 8 needs to be there and line 11 incorrectly adds to the count variable this was correctly determined when reasoning but I mis-selected the answer. </li>
