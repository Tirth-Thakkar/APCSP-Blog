<li>Abstraction hiding aspects of a program to make it more user friendly</li>
<li>Octal, Hexadecimal, decimal, binary, etc., talking about the number of symbols per digit</li>
<li>Have to approach things in a scientific manner - do research</li>
<li>Toggling binary digits of bits to represent different numbers </li>
<li>Does so through transistors that can get turned on and off in patterns can allow for a computer to count in patterns </li>
<li>Binary patterns came to be 20, 21, etc. similar to binary which is base 10</li>
<li>To count higher the number of bits increases, the highest number that can be stored in three bits is 7 and it can increase to store more, usually 8 bits</li>
<li>Letters can also be stored as different values allowing other functions to be possible with a computer </li>
</ul>
